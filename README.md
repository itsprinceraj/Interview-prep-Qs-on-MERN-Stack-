### **1. What are micro and macro queues in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

JavaScript uses an **event loop** to handle asynchronous operations. This event loop manages two main types of queues:

- **Microtask Queue:**

  - **What It Is:** This queue handles tasks that need to be executed immediately after the current script finishes but before any other tasks (macrotasks) are processed.
  - **Examples:** Promises (`.then()`, `.catch()`), `MutationObserver`.
  - **Execution:** Microtasks are processed right after the current task and before any macrotasks or rendering updates.

- **Macrotask Queue:**
  - **What It Is:** This queue handles tasks that are executed after the current script and all microtasks have been processed.
  - **Examples:** `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`, I/O operations (like reading a file).
  - **Execution:** Macrotasks are processed one by one in the order they are scheduled.

**How It Works:**

1. JavaScript runs the current script, including synchronous code.
2. Once the script finishes, the event loop processes all microtasks.
3. After all microtasks are done, the event loop processes one macrotask.
4. If there are any changes that need to be rendered (like updating the UI), those are handled next.

**Example:**

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Macrotask: setTimeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Microtask: Promise");
});

console.log("End");
```

**Output:**

```
Start
End
Microtask: Promise
Macrotask: setTimeout
```

**Explanation:**

- The synchronous logs `Start` and `End` run first.
- The `Promise` (microtask) is executed next because microtasks run before macrotasks.
- The `setTimeout` (macrotask) runs last.

---

### **2. What are promises in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

A **Promise** is a special object in JavaScript used for handling asynchronous operations. It represents a value that may be available now, later, or never.

- **States of a Promise:**

  - **Pending:** The promise is still waiting for the result.
  - **Fulfilled:** The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a result.
  - **Rejected:** The operation failed, and the promise has an error.

- **Methods to Work with Promises:**
  - **`.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)`**: Use this to specify what should happen when the promise is fulfilled or rejected.
  - **`.catch(onRejected)`**: Use this to handle errors.
  - **`.finally(onFinally)`**: Use this to run code after the promise is settled, regardless of the outcome.

**How It Works:**

1. When you create a promise, you provide a function with `resolve` and `reject` arguments.
2. Call `resolve` if the operation is successful or `reject` if it fails.
3. Use `.then()` to handle successful results, `.catch()` to handle errors, and `.finally()` for cleanup.

**Example:**

```javascript
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let success = true; // Simulate a success scenario
  if (success) {
    resolve("Operation was successful!");
  } else {
    reject("Operation failed.");
  }
});

promise
  .then((result) => console.log(result)) // Handles success
  .catch((error) => console.error(error)) // Handles failure
  .finally(() => console.log("Operation finished."));
```

**Explanation:**

- **Promise Creation:** `resolve` or `reject` is called based on whether the operation was successful.
- **Handling Results:** Use `.then()` for success, `.catch()` for errors, and `.finally()` for any code that needs to run after the promise is settled.

---

### **3. How do asynchronous functions work?**

**Explanation:**

**Asynchronous functions** are a modern way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They use the `async` keyword and allow you to use the `await` keyword to pause execution until a promise is settled.

- **`async` Function:**

  - **Definition:** Declares a function that returns a promise. Inside this function, you can use `await` to wait for other promises.
  - **Behavior:** Automatically wraps return values in a promise.

- **`await` Keyword:**
  - **Definition:** Pauses the execution of the `async` function until the promise resolves.
  - **Usage:** Can only be used inside `async` functions.

**How It Works:**

1. Define a function with `async` keyword.
2. Inside this function, use `await` to pause until a promise resolves.
3. Continue with the code after the `await` statement.

**Example:**

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  let result = await new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Data fetched"), 1000)
  );
  console.log(result);
}

fetchData();
console.log("Fetching data...");
```

**Explanation:**

- **`fetchData()`** is an `async` function that waits for the promise to resolve before logging the result.
- **`console.log('Fetching data...')`** executes immediately while waiting for the promise.

---

### **4. What is the Fetch API?**

**Explanation:**

The **Fetch API** is a modern way to make network requests (like HTTP requests) in JavaScript. It provides a simpler and more powerful alternative to older methods like `XMLHttpRequest`.

- **Basic Usage:**

  - **`fetch(url, options)`**: Starts a network request.
  - Returns a **Promise** that resolves to a **Response** object.

- **Response Object:**
  - **`.json()`**: Parses the response body as JSON.
  - **`.text()`**: Parses the response body as plain text.
  - **`.blob()`**: Returns the response body as a binary object.

**How It Works:**

1. Call `fetch()` with the URL and options (if needed).
2. The returned promise resolves to a `Response` object.
3. Use methods like `.json()` to extract data from the response.

**Example:**

```javascript
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
```

**Explanation:**

- **`fetch()`** makes a network request.
- **`.then()`** handles the response and converts it to JSON.
- **`.catch()`** handles any errors that occur during the fetch.

---

### **5. How do arrays and objects work in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

In JavaScript, **arrays** and **objects** are fundamental data structures used to store and manage collections of data.

- **Arrays:**

  - **Definition:** An ordered collection of values. Each value (element) is identified by an index, starting from 0.
  - **Creation:** You create an array using square brackets `[]`.

  **Example:**

  ```javascript
  let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
  console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: 'Apple'
  ```

  - **Common Methods:**
    - **`.push(item)`**: Adds an item to the end.
    - **`.pop()`**: Removes the last item.
    - **`.shift()`**: Removes the first item.
    - **`.unshift(item)`**: Adds an item to the beginning.

- **Objects:**

  - **Definition:** An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key (property) is a string, and each value can be any data type.
  - **Creation:** You create an object using curly braces `{}`.

  **Example:**

  ```javascript
  let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
  };
  console.log(person.name); // Output: 'John'
  ```

  - **Common Methods:**
    - **`.hasOwnProperty(key)`**: Checks if an object has a specific property.
    - **`delete object.key`**: Removes a property.

**How They Work:**

- **Arrays** are indexed collections, ideal for ordered data and list operations.
- **Objects** are key-value pairs, suitable for structured data and lookups.

### **6. What is the event loop in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

The **event loop** is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations like I/O, network requests, and timers without blocking the main thread.

- **How It Works:**

  1. **Call Stack:** This is where JavaScript executes synchronous code. It follows Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
  2. **Task Queues:** Includes microtasks (e.g., promises) and macrotasks (e.g., `setTimeout`).
  3. **Event Loop:** Continuously checks if the call stack is empty and then processes tasks from the queues.

- **Process:**
  1. Execute all the synchronous code in the call stack.
  2. Process all microtasks (like promises).
  3. Process one macrotask (like `setTimeout`).
  4. Render updates (if necessary).

**Example:**

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Macrotask: setTimeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Microtask: Promise");
});

console.log("End");
```

**Explanation:**

- **Synchronous Code:** `Start` and `End` are printed first.
- **Microtasks:** `Promise` is printed next.
- **Macrotasks:** `setTimeout` is printed last.

---

### **7. How does the call stack work in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

The **call stack** is a data structure used by JavaScript to keep track of function calls and their execution contexts.

- **How It Works:**
  1. **Push:** When a function is called, its context (information about the function) is pushed onto the stack.
  2. **Pop:** When the function completes, its context is popped off the stack.
  3. **Execution Order:** Functions are executed in the order they are called and completed.

**Example:**

```javascript
function first() {
  console.log("First");
  second();
}

function second() {
  console.log("Second");
}

first();
```

**Explanation:**

- **Call Stack Execution:** `first()` is pushed onto the stack, executes, calls `second()`, which is then pushed and executed.
- **Stack Unwinds:** After `second()` completes, it's popped off, followed by `first()`.

---

### **8. What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)?**

**Explanation:**

**CORS** is a security feature that allows or restricts web applications running at one origin to access resources from another origin (domain).

- **What It Does:**

  - **Allows Safe Cross-Origin Requests:** CORS specifies which domains are permitted to access resources on your server.
  - **Preflight Requests:** For certain types of requests (like those with custom headers or methods), browsers send an OPTIONS request to check permissions.

- **Headers Used:**
  - **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin:`** Specifies which domains are allowed.
  - **`Access-Control-Allow-Methods:`** Specifies which HTTP methods are allowed.
  - **`Access-Control-Allow-Headers:`** Specifies which headers can be used in requests.

**Example:**

**Server Response Headers:**

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com
```

**Client Request:**

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
```

**Explanation:**

- **Server Side:** Configures headers to allow requests from specific domains.
- **Client Side:** The browser checks CORS headers and either allows or blocks the request based on the server's response.

---

### **9. What are security considerations like XSS and CSRF?**

**Explanation:**

**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** An attack where an attacker injects malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users.

- **Types of XSS:**

  - **Stored XSS:** Malicious script is stored on the server and served to users.
  - **Reflected XSS:** Malicious script is reflected off a server, like in URL parameters.

- **Prevention:**
  - **Sanitize Inputs:** Ensure user inputs are clean.
  - **Escape Outputs:** Encode data before rendering on the page.

**CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** An attack where unauthorized commands are sent from a user that the web application trusts.

- **How It Works:**

  - An attacker tricks the user into submitting a request to another site where the user is authenticated.

- **Prevention:**
  - **CSRF Tokens:** Include unique tokens in forms to verify requests.
  - **SameSite Cookies:** Restrict cookies from being sent with cross-site requests.

**Example of CSRF Prevention:**

```html
<form method="POST" action="/update">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrfToken" value="unique_token" />
  <button type="submit">Update</button>
</form>
```

**Explanation:**

- **XSS:** Properly handle user inputs and outputs to avoid script injection.
- **CSRF:** Use tokens and cookie attributes to prevent unauthorized requests.

### **10. How do local storage and session storage work, and what are their methods?**

**Explanation:**

**Local Storage** and **Session Storage** are both part of the Web Storage API that allows storing data on the client side.

- **Local Storage:**

  - **Persistence:** Data persists even after the browser is closed.
  - **Usage:** Suitable for storing data that should be retained across sessions.

- **Session Storage:**

  - **Persistence:** Data is cleared when the page session ends (i.e., when the page is closed).
  - **Usage:** Suitable for storing data that should only be available during a single session.

- **Common Methods:**
  - **`.setItem(key, value)`**: Stores a value.
  - **`.getItem(key)`**: Retrieves a value.
  - **`.removeItem(key)`**: Removes an item.
  - **`.clear()`**: Clears all data.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Local Storage
localStorage.setItem("name", "John");
console.log(localStorage.getItem("name")); // Output: 'John'

// Session Storage
sessionStorage.setItem("sessionName", "Doe");
console.log(sessionStorage.getItem("sessionName")); // Output: 'Doe'
```

**Explanation:**

- **Local Storage** keeps data available across browser sessions.
- **Session Storage** keeps data available only during the current browser session.

### **11. What are floats and clearing in CSS?**

**Explanation:**

**Floats** and **clearing** are techniques used in CSS for layout and positioning elements on a webpage.

- **Floats:**

  - **Purpose:** To position an element to the left or right of its container, allowing other content to wrap around it.
  - **Common Uses:** For text wrapping around images or creating multi-column layouts.

  **Example:**

  ```css
  .float-left {
    float: left;
    margin-right: 10px;
  }

  .float-right {
    float: right;
    margin-left: 10px;
  }
  ```

  **HTML:**

  ```html
  <img src="example.jpg" class="float-left" alt="Example" />
  <p>This text will wrap around the floated image.</p>
  ```

  **Explanation:**

  - The image floats to the left, and the text wraps around it.

- **Clearing:**

  - **Purpose:** To control the behavior of elements after floated elements, ensuring that they start below any preceding floated elements.
  - **Common Properties:**
    - **`clear: both;`**: Clears both left and right floats.
    - **`clear: left;`**: Clears left floats.
    - **`clear: right;`**: Clears right floats.

  **Example:**

  ```css
  .clearfix::after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
    clear: both;
  }
  ```

  **HTML:**

  ```html
  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="example.jpg" class="float-left" alt="Example" />
    <p>This text will wrap around the floated image.</p>
  </div>
  ```

  **Explanation:**

  - The `.clearfix` class ensures that any floating elements inside the container are cleared, so the container expands to include its floated children.

---

### **12. What are CSS preprocessors (e.g., Sass, Less)? What is the importance of the `@import` keyword?**

**Explanation:**

**CSS preprocessors** like **Sass** and **Less** extend CSS with features that make it easier to write and maintain complex stylesheets.

- **Sass:**

  - **Features:**
    - **Variables:** Store values like colors and fonts for reuse.
    - **Nesting:** Nest CSS rules inside one another to reflect HTML structure.
    - **Mixins:** Reusable chunks of code.

  **Example:**

  ```scss
  $primary-color: #333;

  .header {
    color: $primary-color;
    .title {
      font-size: 2em;
    }
  }
  ```

  - **Compilation:** Sass files (`.scss` or `.sass`) are compiled into standard CSS.

- **Less:**

  - **Features:**
    - **Variables:** Similar to Sass for reusing values.
    - **Mixins:** Reusable styles.
    - **Operations:** Perform calculations with values.

  **Example:**

  ```less
  @primary-color: #333;

  .header {
    color: @primary-color;
    .title {
      font-size: 2em;
    }
  }
  ```

  - **Compilation:** Less files (`.less`) are compiled into CSS.

- **Importance of `@import`:**

  - **Usage:** Allows importing CSS or preprocessor files into another file.
  - **Benefits:**
    - **Modularization:** Break down large CSS files into smaller, manageable pieces.
    - **Reusability:** Import common styles across multiple stylesheets.

  **Example:**

  ```scss
  @import "variables";
  @import "mixins";

  .header {
    color: $primary-color;
  }
  ```

  **Explanation:**

  - **`@import`** helps keep stylesheets organized and manageable by importing common files or modules.

---

### **13. What are vendor prefixes, and how do they affect browser compatibility?**

**Explanation:**

**Vendor prefixes** are used to ensure that experimental or non-standard CSS properties work in different browsers.

- **Purpose:** They provide support for new CSS features before they become standardized.

- **Common Prefixes:**

  - **`-webkit-`**: For WebKit-based browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari).
  - **`-moz-`**: For Mozilla-based browsers (e.g., Firefox).
  - **`-ms-`**: For Microsoft browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer, Edge).
  - **`-o-`**: For Opera.

- **Example:**

  ```css
  .box {
    -webkit-border-radius: 10px; /* Chrome, Safari */
    -moz-border-radius: 10px; /* Firefox */
    border-radius: 10px; /* Standard */
  }
  ```

- **Impact on Compatibility:**
  - **Browser Support:** Prefixes ensure that features are available in browsers that don’t yet support the standard property.
  - **Fallbacks:** Always provide the standard property after the prefixed versions to cover browsers that support the standard.

**Explanation:**

- **Vendor Prefixes** help developers use experimental CSS features while maintaining compatibility with multiple browsers.

---

### **14. What are CSS methodologies (e.g., BEM, SMACSS)?**

**Explanation:**

**CSS methodologies** are approaches to organizing and managing CSS to improve maintainability and scalability.

- **BEM (Block Element Modifier):**

  - **Concept:** Divides CSS into blocks (independent components), elements (parts of blocks), and modifiers (variations).
  - **Naming Convention:** Use a structured naming pattern to avoid conflicts and improve clarity.

  **Example:**

  ```html
  <div class="button button--primary">
    <span class="button__text">Click me</span>
  </div>
  ```

  **CSS:**

  ```css
  .button {
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
  }

  .button--primary {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
  }

  .button__text {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
  ```

- **SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS):**

  - **Concept:** Organizes CSS into categories like Base, Layout, Module, State, and Theme.
  - **Purpose:** Encourages modular and scalable CSS by structuring styles into logical components.

  **Example:**

  ```css
  /* Layout */
  .header {
    ...;
  }

  /* Module */
  .card {
    ...;
  }

  /* State */
  .is-active {
    ...;
  }
  ```

**Explanation:**

- **BEM** provides a clear structure for naming and organizing CSS to avoid conflicts and improve readability.
- **SMACSS** offers a flexible approach to structuring stylesheets for maintainability and scalability.

---

### **15. What are CSS variables (custom properties)?**

**Explanation:**

**CSS variables**, also known as **custom properties**, allow you to store and reuse values throughout your CSS.

- **Definition:** Variables defined using the `--` prefix, and used with the `var()` function.

- **Creation and Usage:**

  - **Define Variables:**

    ```css
    :root {
      --main-color: #3498db;
      --padding: 10px;
    }
    ```

  - **Use Variables:**
    ```css
    .box {
      background-color: var(--main-color);
      padding: var(--padding);
    }
    ```

- **Benefits:**

  - **Reusability:** Use the same value throughout your stylesheets.
  - **Maintainability:** Easily update the value in one place.
  - **Dynamic Changes:** Variables can be changed using JavaScript.

  **Example:**

  ```javascript
  document.documentElement.style.setProperty("--main-color", "#e74c3c");
  ```

**Explanation:**

- **CSS Variables** provide a way to define reusable values that can be changed dynamically, improving maintainability and flexibility in your stylesheets.

### **16. Is `useState` scheduled? If yes, why? What is `useState`'s `prevState`?**

**Explanation:**

In React, **`useState`** is a hook that lets you add state to functional components.

- **Is `useState` Scheduled?**

  - **Scheduling:** React schedules state updates to be processed in batches for performance reasons. This means that updates may not happen immediately but will be applied in the next render cycle.

- **Why Scheduling:**

  - **Performance:** Batch updates reduce the number of re-renders and improve application performance.

- **What is `prevState`:**

  - **`prevState`** is used to access the previous state value when updating state. This is crucial when updating state based on the previous value.

  **Example:**

  ```javascript
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  };
  ```

  **Explanation:**

  - **`prevState` Function:** Ensures you get the latest state value when updating, preventing issues with stale state in asynchronous updates.

---

### **17. Why is a `useState` variable declared as a constant but still mutable?**

**Explanation:**

**`useState`** returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that value. The state itself is mutable, but

the state variable is declared as a constant.

- **Constant Declaration:**

  - The `const` keyword ensures that the reference to the `useState` hook’s return value cannot be reassigned, meaning you cannot change what `count` refers to.

- **Mutable Nature of State:**

  - Although `count` is a constant reference, the state value it holds can be updated using the updater function (`setCount`).

  **Example:**

  ```javascript
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // count is a constant reference, but its value can be updated
  setCount(count + 1);
  ```

**Explanation:**

- **`const`** ensures the reference to the state value doesn’t change, but the state itself is mutable through the updater function.

---

### **18. Why is React Router used?**

**Explanation:**

**React Router** is a library used for handling routing in React applications, enabling navigation between different components or pages.

- **Purpose:**

  - **Single Page Applications (SPAs):** Manage navigation without reloading the page.
  - **Dynamic Routing:** Define routes based on the application’s state or URL parameters.

- **Benefits:**

  - **Declarative Routing:** Define routes using React components.
  - **Nested Routing:** Create nested routes for complex layouts.

  **Example:**

  ```javascript
  import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";

  function App() {
    return (
      <Router>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
          <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        </Switch>
      </Router>
    );
  }
  ```

**Explanation:**

- **React Router** simplifies routing in SPAs, allowing developers to define routes as React components and manage navigation without page reloads.

---

### **19. What does the `index` keyword do in React Router?**

**Explanation:**

In **React Router**, the **`index`** keyword is used in the context of nested routes to define the default route within a parent route.

- **Purpose:**

  - **Index Route:** Specifies which component should be rendered when the parent route is matched but no child routes are specified.

  **Example:**

  ```javascript
  import { Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";

  function App() {
    return (
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
          <Route index element={<Home />} /> {/* Index route */}
          <Route path="about" element={<About />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    );
  }
  ```

**Explanation:**

- **Index Route** renders the specified component (`<Home />`) when the parent route (`"/"`) is matched, providing a default view.

---

### **20. What is the `some()` method in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

The **`some()`** method is an array method in JavaScript that tests whether at least one element in the array passes a test provided by a function.

- **Syntax:**

  ```javascript
  array.some(callback(element, index, array));
  ```

- **Parameters:**

  - **`callback`**: A function that tests each element. It returns `true` if the test passes, `false` otherwise.

- **Returns:**
  - **`true`** if at least one element passes the test.
  - **`false`** if no elements pass the test.

**Example:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const hasEven = numbers.some((num) => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(hasEven); // Output: true
```

**Explanation:**

- **`some()`** checks if there’s at least one even number in the array and returns `true` if so.

---

### **21. What is the `useRef()` hook in React?**

**Explanation:**

The **`useRef()`** hook is used to create a mutable reference that persists across re-renders in a functional component.

- **Purpose:**

  - **Access DOM Elements:** Get direct access to DOM elements.
  - **Store Mutable Values:** Keep mutable values that don’t trigger re-renders.

- **Usage:**

  - **DOM Access:**

    ```javascript
    const inputRef = useRef(null);

    useEffect(() => {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    }, []);
    ```

  - **Storing Values:**

    ```javascript
    const countRef = useRef(0);

    const increment = () => {
      countRef.current += 1;
      console.log(countRef.current);
    };
    ```

**Explanation:**

- **`useRef()`** provides a way to persist values across renders without causing re-renders, making it useful for accessing DOM elements and storing mutable values.

---

### **22. What is the `useOnClickOutside()` hook in React?**

**Explanation:**

The **`useOnClickOutside()`** hook is a custom hook used to detect clicks outside of a specified element, useful for handling click events that close modals or dropdowns.

- **Purpose:**

  - **Detect Outside Clicks:** Trigger an action when a user clicks outside a specified element.

- **Implementation:**

  - **Example Hook:**

    ```javascript
    import { useEffect } from "react";

    function useOnClickOutside(ref, handler) {
      useEffect(() => {
        const handleClick = (event) => {
          if (ref.current && !ref.current.contains(event.target)) {
            handler(event);
          }
        };

        document.addEventListener("mousedown", handleClick);
        return () => document.removeEventListener("mousedown", handleClick);
      }, [ref, handler]);
    }
    ```

  - **Usage:**

    ```javascript
    const ref = useRef();

    useOnClickOutside(ref, () => {
      console.log("Clicked outside!");
    });

### **40. What are the phases of events in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

Events in JavaScript go through several phases during their lifecycle:

1. **Capturing Phase:**

   - **Description:** The event starts from the top of the DOM hierarchy and travels down to the target element.
   - **Usage:** Rarely used; you can listen for events during this phase by setting the `capture` parameter to `true`.

2. **Target Phase:**

   - **Description:** The event is dispatched to the target element where it was actually triggered.

3. **Bubbling Phase:**
   - **Description:** The event bubbles up from the target element to the top of the DOM hierarchy.
   - **Usage:** Commonly used; allows parent elements to respond to events triggered by their children.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener(
  "click",
  (event) => {
    console.log("Button clicked");
  },
  true
); // `true` for capturing phase, `false` for bubbling phase
```

**Explanation:**

- **Event Phases** determine how events propagate through the DOM, allowing fine-grained control over event handling.

---

### **41. What is `flushSync()` in React?**

**Explanation:**

**`flushSync()`** is a React API used to force a synchronous update of the React state. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to ensure that the DOM updates immediately.

  import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";

  function App() {
    return (
      <Router>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/home" component={HomePage} />
          <Route path="/about" component={AboutPage} />
          <Route path="/" component={MainPage} />
        </Switch>
      </Router>
    );
  }
  ```

**Explanation:**

- **React Router DOM** simplifies managing navigation and routing in React applications, allowing for a more dynamic and interactive user experience.

### **47. What is hoisting in JavaScript for functions and variables?**

**Explanation:**

**Hoisting** is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function

declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation.

- **Variables:**

  - **`var`** declarations are hoisted and initialized to `undefined`.
  - **`let`** and **`const`** declarations are hoisted but not initialized; accessing them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

- **Functions:**
  - Function declarations are hoisted along with their definitions, so you can call them before their declaration in the code.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined
var x = 5;

foo(); // Outputs: "Hello"
function foo() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Hoisting** allows for flexible coding practices, but understanding how it works can help prevent unexpected behavior and bugs.

---

### **48. What are scopes in JavaScript, and what is lexical scoping?**

**Explanation:**

**Scope** determines the visibility of variables and functions in different parts of your code.

- **Global Scope:** Variables declared outside of functions are in the global scope and accessible anywhere.
- **Function Scope:** Variables declared within a function are only accessible inside that function.

**Lexical Scoping:** Refers to how variable scope is determined based on the location where variables are declared. Inner functions have access to variables from outer functions.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVar = "I am outside";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVar); // Accesses outerVar due to lexical scoping
  }

  innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
```

**Explanation:**

- **Lexical scoping** ensures that nested functions have access to variables from their parent functions, which is fundamental to JavaScript's function scope.

---

### **49. What is closure in JavaScript, and what is the difference between closure and lexical scoping?**

**Explanation:**

**Closure** is a feature where a function retains access to its lexical scope even after it has finished executing.

- **Usage Example:**

  ```javascript
  function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;

    return function () {
      count += 1;
      return count;
    };
  }

  const counter = createCounter();
  console.log(counter()); // Outputs: 1
  console.log(counter()); // Outputs: 2
  ```

**Difference from Lexical Scoping:**

- **Lexical Scoping** determines the visibility of variables based on their location in the code.
- **Closure** allows functions to retain access to variables from their containing scope even after the outer function has completed.

**Explanation:**

- **Closures** are useful for creating private variables and functions, enabling more powerful and flexible code structures.

---

### **50. Why is `Route` in React Router nested under `Routes`?**

**Explanation:**

In **React Router v6**, the **`Routes`** component is used to group **`Route`** components and provide a more structured and efficient way to define and manage routes.

- **Usage Example:**

  ```javascript
  import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

  function App() {
    return (
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/home" element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<AboutPage />} />
        <Route path="/" element={<MainPage />} />
      </Routes>
    );
  }
  ```

**Explanation:**

- **`Routes`** is a container that handles the matching of routes and rendering of components. This helps in organizing routes and managing nested routing more effectively.

---

### **51. What is the difference between `redirect` and `navigate()` in React Router?**

**Explanation:**

- **`redirect`:**

  - **Purpose:** Used to redirect users to a different route.
  - **Usage (React Router v5):**

    ```javascript
    import { Redirect } from "react-router-dom";

    function MyComponent() {
      return <Redirect to="/home" />;
    }
    ```

- **`navigate()`:**

  - **Purpose:** Provides programmatic navigation to different routes.
  - **Usage (React Router v6):**

    ```javascript
    import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

    function MyComponent() {
      const navigate = useNavigate();

      const handleClick = () => {
        navigate("/home");
      };

      return <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to Home</button>;
    }
    ```

**Explanation:**

- **`redirect`** is a declarative way to navigate, while **`navigate()`** provides a programmatic approach to routing in React Router.

---

### **52. How does the parent route work in React Router, and how are child routes handled?**

**Explanation:**

**Parent routes** define a base route and can contain child routes that render components within the parent route's context.

- **Usage Example:**

  ```javascript
  import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

  function ParentComponent() {
    return (
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/parent" element={<ParentPage />}>
          <Route path="child1" element={<ChildPage1 />} />
          <Route path="child2" element={<ChildPage2 />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    );
  }
  ```

**Explanation:**

- **Child routes** are nested under parent routes, allowing for more granular control over rendering and route matching. This enables creating hierarchical routing structures.

---

### **53. How does Redux Toolkit work internally?**

**Explanation:**

**Redux Toolkit** is a library that simplifies Redux state management with a set of utilities and best practices.

- **Key Features:**
  - **`createSlice`:** Defines reducers and actions in one place.
  - **`configureStore`:** Sets up the Redux store with sensible defaults.
  - **`createAsyncThunk`:** Handles asynchronous logic with a simple API.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
import { createSlice, configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: 0,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => state + 1,
    decrement: (state) => state - 1,
  },
});

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: counterSlice.reducer,
});
```

**Explanation:**

- **Redux Toolkit** abstracts much of the boilerplate code and provides a more streamlined way to manage Redux state, making it easier to work with.

---

### **54. Why is a bearer token more secure than using cookies and body parsers?**

**Explanation:**

**Bearer tokens** are used for authentication and are included in HTTP headers. They provide better security compared to cookies and body parsers.

- **Advantages:**
  - **Less Susceptible to CSRF:** Since bearer tokens are included in the Authorization header, they are not vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
  - **More Control:** Tokens can be easily invalidated or rotated.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/data", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
});
```

**Explanation:**

- **Bearer tokens** improve security by avoiding common vulnerabilities associated with cookies and body parsers, such as CSRF attacks.

---

### **55. Why is fetching a token from the header more secure than from the body or cookies?**

**Explanation:**

**Fetching tokens from HTTP headers** is generally more secure than from the body or cookies due to several reasons:

- **Headers are Not Accessible via JavaScript:** Tokens in headers are not accessible from JavaScript running on the client-side, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.
- **Avoids CSRF Risks:** Using headers avoids the risks of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because headers are not automatically sent with cross-origin requests.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/data", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
});
```

**Explanation:**

- Fetching tokens from headers enhances security by protecting tokens from being exposed to client-side scripts and cross-site attacks.

---

### **56. What are the various methods of JWT, and what is the significance of `saltRound`?**

**Explanation:**

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** methods include:

- **`HS256`:** HMAC using SHA-256, a symmetric key algorithm.
- **`RS256`:** RSA Signature with SHA-256, an asymmetric key algorithm.
- **`ES256`:** ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256, an elliptic curve algorithm.

**`saltRound`** is related to password hashing and not directly to JWT. It refers to the number of rounds used to generate a salted hash, which adds security to password storage.

**Usage Example for JWT:**

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const token = jwt.sign({ id: userId }, "secretKey", { algorithm: "HS256" });
```

**Explanation:**

- **JWT** provides methods for secure token generation and verification, while **saltRound** enhances password hashing security.

---

### **57. What are Mongoose methods?**

**Explanation:**

**Mongoose** is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing methods to interact with MongoDB collections.

- **Common Methods:**
  - **`find()`:** Retrieves documents based on criteria.
  - **`findById()`:** Retrieves a document by its ID.
  - **`save()`:** Saves a new document or updates an existing one

.

- **`remove()`:** Removes documents based on criteria.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const user = new User({ name: "John Doe" });
user.save().then(() => console.log("User saved"));
User.find({ name: "John Doe" }).then((users) => console.log(users));
```

**Explanation:**

- **Mongoose methods** simplify CRUD operations with MongoDB, providing a higher-level API to interact with database collections.

---

### **58. How do JWT and cookies work? What is the SHA-256 algorithm?**

**Explanation:**

**JWT** (JSON Web Token) and **cookies** are often used together for authentication:

- **JWT:** Used for stateless authentication. The server issues a token to the client, which the client sends back in subsequent requests.
- **Cookies:** Can store the JWT for client-side access. They are automatically sent with HTTP requests.

**SHA-256** is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit hash value, often used for securely hashing data.

**Usage Example for JWT in Cookies:**

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const token = jwt.sign({ id: userId }, "secretKey", { algorithm: "HS256" });

// Set token in cookie
res.cookie("token", token, { httpOnly: true });
```

**Explanation:**

- **JWT** provides stateless authentication, while **cookies** help manage and store JWTs on the client side. **SHA-256** is used to ensure data integrity and security.

---

### **59. Why is fetching a token from the body less secure?**

**Explanation:**

Fetching a token from the **body** of a request is less secure due to:

- **Exposure:** Tokens in the body are accessible through JavaScript on the client-side, increasing the risk of exposure via XSS attacks.
- **Less Standard:** Using headers is a more common and standardized approach for token management.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
// Less secure approach
fetch("https://api.example.com/data", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ token: "yourToken" }),
});
```

**Explanation:**

- **Fetching tokens from the body** introduces security risks, making it less favorable compared to using HTTP headers for token management.

---

### **60. What is cookie hijacking and token hijacking?**

**Explanation:**

- **Cookie Hijacking:** Refers to the theft of cookies from a user’s browser, potentially gaining unauthorized access to their session.
- **Token Hijacking:** Involves stealing authentication tokens, which can be used to impersonate the user or access restricted resources.

**Mitigation:**

- **Use Secure Flags:** For cookies, use `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags.
- **Use HTTPS:** Ensure data is encrypted during transmission.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
// Setting a secure cookie
res.cookie("token", "yourToken", { httpOnly: true, secure: true });
```

**Explanation:**

- **Cookie and token hijacking** are security risks that can be mitigated by using secure flags and encrypted connections.

---

### **61. What are pre and post middleware in backend development?**

**Explanation:**

**Pre Middleware:**

- **Purpose:** Executed before the main request handler. Used for tasks like authentication, logging, or validation.

**Post Middleware:**

- **Purpose:** Executed after the main request handler. Used for tasks like response formatting or cleanup.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Pre middleware for logging
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Request received");
  next();
});

// Main request handler
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World");
});

// Post middleware for response modification
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.send("Response modified");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Explanation:**

- **Pre and post middleware** allow for flexible request handling and processing in backend applications, making it easier to manage different aspects of request and response life cycles.

---

### **62. What are AWS services like SQS and SNS?**

**Explanation:**

- **SQS (Simple Queue Service):**

  - **Purpose:** Provides a fully managed message queue service for storing and managing messages between distributed system components.
  - **Use Case:** Decoupling and scaling microservices.

- **SNS (Simple Notification Service):**
  - **Purpose:** Provides a fully managed publish/subscribe messaging service for sending notifications to subscribers.
  - **Use Case:** Sending alerts or notifications to multiple endpoints.

**Usage Example for SQS:**

```javascript
const AWS = require("aws-sdk");
const sqs = new AWS.SQS();

const params = {
  MessageBody: "Hello World",
  QueueUrl: "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/MyQueue",
};

sqs.sendMessage(params, (err, data) => {
  if (err) console.log(err);
  else console.log(data);
});
```

**Explanation:**

- **SQS** and **SNS** are AWS services for managing messaging and notifications, helping in building scalable and reliable distributed systems.

---

### **63. What is a cron job?**

**Explanation:**

A **cron job** is a scheduled task that runs at specified intervals or times on a Unix-like operating system.

- **Usage Example:**

  - **Cron Syntax:** `* * * * * command` (minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week)

- **Example Cron Job:**
  ```bash
  # Run a script every day at midnight
  0 0 * * * /path/to/script.sh
  ```

**Explanation:**

- **Cron jobs** are used for automating repetitive tasks like backups, system maintenance, or scheduled reports.

---

### **64. What is a proxy server, and how does it work?**

**Explanation:**

A **proxy server** acts as an intermediary between a client and a destination server, handling requests and responses on behalf of the client.

- **Purpose:**
  - **Anonymity:** Hides the client’s IP address.
  - **Caching:** Stores frequently accessed data to improve performance.
  - **Filtering:** Blocks access to certain content or websites.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const http = require("http");
const httpProxy = require("http-proxy");

const proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer({});

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  proxy.web(req, res, { target: "http://example.com" });
});

server.listen(8000);
```

**Explanation:**

- **Proxy servers** enhance security, performance, and control over network traffic by managing requests and responses between clients and servers.

---

### **65. What is the difference between SHA (Secure Hashing Algorithm) and HMAC (Hashed-Based Message Authentication Code)?**

**Explanation:**

- **SHA (Secure Hashing Algorithm):**

  - **Purpose:** Produces a hash value from input data. It is used for data integrity checks.
  - **Example:** SHA-256 produces a 256-bit hash value.

- **HMAC (Hashed-Based Message Authentication Code):**
  - **Purpose:** Combines a hash function with a secret key to provide data integrity and authenticity.
  - **Example:** HMAC-SHA256 uses SHA-256 with a secret key.

**Usage Example for HMAC:**

```javascript
const crypto = require("crypto");
const secret = "mySecretKey";
const hash = crypto
  .createHmac("sha256", secret)
  .update("message")
  .digest("hex");
console.log(hash);
```

**Explanation:**

- **SHA** provides hash values for data integrity, while **HMAC** adds an additional layer of security by using a secret key to validate the authenticity of the data.

---

### **66. How does element matching and equality work in Mongoose?**

**Explanation:**

In **Mongoose**, element matching and equality queries are used to find documents based on specific criteria.

- **Equality Query:**

  - **Usage:** Matches documents where a field is equal to a specified value.
  - **Example:**
    ```javascript
    User.find({ name: "John Doe" }).then((users) => console.log(users));
    ```

- **Element Matching:**
  - **Usage:** Matches documents based on the presence or absence of elements.
  - **Example:**
    ```javascript
    User.find({ age: { $exists: true } }).then((users) => console.log(users));
    ```

**Explanation:**

- **Element matching** allows for flexible querying based on document structure, while **equality queries** help retrieve documents with specific field values.

---

### **67. What are aggregate methods in Mongoose?**

**Explanation:**

**Aggregate methods** in Mongoose are used to perform complex queries and data transformations, such as filtering, grouping, and sorting.

- **Common Methods:**
  - **`$match`:** Filters documents based on criteria.
  - **`$group`:** Groups documents by a specified field.
  - **`$sort`:** Sorts documents based on a field.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
User.aggregate([
  { $match: { age: { $gte: 18 } } },
  { $group: { _id: "$city", count: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { count: -1 } },
]).then((result) => console.log(result));
```

**Explanation:**

- **Aggregate methods** enable powerful data analysis and transformation capabilities in Mongoose, allowing for complex querying and reporting.

---

### **68. What is Hoisting in js?**

In JavaScript, **hoisting** refers to the process by which the JavaScript engine moves declarations (variables and functions) to the top of their respective scopes before execution. This means that you can use variables and functions **before** they are actually declared in the code.

### How Hoisting Works:

- **Variable and function declarations** are moved to the top of their scope (global or function scope).
- Only **declarations** are hoisted, not the initializations (i.e., assignments of values).

### Hoisting with Variables

In the case of variables, only the **declaration** is hoisted, but not the initialization.

#### Example 1: Hoisting with `var`

```javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
console.log(x); // 5
```

In the code above:

1. JavaScript hoists the **declaration** of `x`, so it treats the code as:
   ```javascript
   var x;
   console.log(x); // undefined
   x = 5;
   console.log(x); // 5
   ```
   Even though `x` is used before it’s declared, the declaration is hoisted, but its assignment (`x = 5`) is not. Therefore, `x` is `undefined` until the line `x = 5` is executed.

#### Example 2: Hoisting with `let` and `const`

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted, but they are not initialized until their definition is reached in the code. If you try to access them before the declaration, it results in a **ReferenceError** because they are in the **temporal dead zone**.

```javascript
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
let y = 10;
```

In this case, the declaration is hoisted, but since `y` is not initialized yet, you get a reference error when trying to access it before its initialization.

### Hoisting with Functions

Yes, **hoisting also works for functions**, but there’s an important distinction between **function declarations** and **function expressions**.

#### 1. **Function Declarations**

Function declarations are **completely hoisted**, meaning both the function’s definition and declaration are moved to the top of their scope. You can call a function even before it is defined in the code.

##### Example of Function Declaration Hoisting:

```javascript
foo(); // "Hello, World!"

function foo() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

This works because function declarations are fully hoisted, and the code is treated as if the function declaration was at the top.

#### 2. **Function Expressions**

In the case of function expressions (when a function is assigned to a variable), only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function definition. If you try to invoke the function before the expression is defined, you'll get an error.

##### Example of Function Expression:

```javascript
bar(); // TypeError: bar is not a function

var bar = function () {
  console.log("This is a function expression.");
};
```

Here’s what happens:

1. The variable `bar` is hoisted, but it’s initialized to `undefined`.
2. Trying to invoke `bar()` before the assignment results in `TypeError` because `bar` is `undefined` at the time of the call.

### Summary

- **Hoisting** is the behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
- **Variables declared with `var`** are hoisted, but only their declaration (not their assignment), and they are initialized with `undefined`.
- **Variables declared with `let` and `const`** are hoisted but exist in a temporal dead zone until they are initialized.
- **Function declarations** are fully hoisted, meaning you can call them before their definition.
- **Function expressions** (when assigned to a variable) only have the variable declaration hoisted, not the function definition.

This difference is crucial when determining where and when you can use a function in your code.

### **69. What are JavaScript decorators, and how are they used?**

**Explanation:**

**Decorators** are a proposed JavaScript feature (currently at stage 2 in the TC39 process) that allows developers to modify classes and their members.

- **Usage:**
  - **Add Metadata:** Attach additional information to classes or methods.
  - **Modify Behavior:** Enhance or alter class methods and properties.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
function readonly(target, key, descriptor) {
  descriptor.writable = false;
  return descriptor;
}

class Example {
  @readonly
  method() {
    console.log("This method cannot be modified");
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Decorators** provide a way to add metadata and modify class behavior in a declarative manner, though they are not yet a standard feature in JavaScript.

---

### **70. What are some common HTTP status codes and their meanings?**

**Explanation:**

**Common HTTP Status Codes:**

- **200 OK:** The request was successful.
- **201 Created:** The request was successful, and a new resource was created.
- **400 Bad Request:** The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized:** Authentication is required and has failed or has not been provided.
- **404 Not Found:** The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** The server encountered an error and could not complete the request.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
res.status(404).send("Resource not found");
```

**Explanation:**

- **HTTP status codes** communicate the result of an HTTP request, helping clients understand the outcome and take appropriate actions.

---

### **71. What is the purpose of API versioning, and what methods are commonly used?**

**Explanation:**

**API Versioning** ensures backward compatibility and allows for incremental improvements without breaking existing clients.

- **Common Methods:**
  - **URL Path Versioning:** Including the version number in the URL path (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`).
  - **Query Parameter Versioning:** Using a query parameter to specify the version (e.g., `/api/resource?version=1`).
  - **Header Versioning:** Specifying the version in request headers (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json`).

**Usage Example (URL Path Versioning):**

```javascript
app.use("/api/v1/resource", v1ResourceRouter);
app.use("/api/v2/resource", v2ResourceRouter);
```

**Explanation:**

- **API versioning** helps manage changes and updates in APIs, ensuring smooth transitions and compatibility for clients.

---

### **72. What is Temporal Dead Zone(TDZ) in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

The **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** in JavaScript refers to the period between the entering of a scope (like a block or function) and the point where a variable declared with `let` or `const` is initialized. During this period, the variable exists but cannot be accessed, and attempting to do so will result in a **ReferenceError**.

### Key Points about the Temporal Dead Zone:

1. **TDZ starts at the beginning of the scope** where the variable is declared (e.g., a function or block).
2. The variable is in the TDZ until the code execution reaches the line where the variable is declared and initialized.
3. Any attempt to access the variable before its declaration and initialization will throw a **ReferenceError**.
4. Once the declaration is encountered, the variable is no longer in the TDZ and can be used.

### Example of the Temporal Dead Zone

```javascript
{
  console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
  let x = 10;
  console.log(x); // 10
}
```

- The variable `x` is in the TDZ from the start of the block until its declaration (`let x = 10;`).
- Accessing `x` before this declaration causes a **ReferenceError** because it is in the TDZ.
- After the line `let x = 10;` executes, the variable is initialized and can be accessed normally.

### Temporal Dead Zone with `const`

The TDZ also applies to variables declared with `const`. The key difference is that variables declared with `const` must be initialized at the time of declaration, so the TDZ lasts until the point where the variable is declared and initialized.

```javascript
{
  console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
  const y = 5;
  console.log(y); // 5
}
```

- The variable `y` is in the TDZ until the `const y = 5;` declaration and initialization.
- After that, it can be used normally.

### Why the Temporal Dead Zone Exists

The TDZ exists because of how `let` and `const` are designed to work differently from `var`. Unlike `var`, which hoists the variable declaration and initializes it with `undefined`, `let` and `const` are not initialized until the actual line of code where they are defined. This design helps prevent bugs caused by accessing variables before they are meaningfully initialized.

### Key Differences Between `var`, `let`, and `const` Regarding Hoisting and TDZ

- **`var`:** Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`. This allows them to be accessed before their declaration, though they won't have a value until they're assigned one. No TDZ exists for `var`.

  ```javascript
  console.log(a); // undefined
  var a = 3;
  console.log(a); // 3
  ```

- **`let` and `const`:** Variables declared with `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized until the point of declaration, meaning they are in the TDZ and cannot be accessed before their declaration. If you try to access them before that point, a **ReferenceError** occurs.
  ```javascript
  console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
  let b = 3;
  console.log(b); // 3
  ```

### Summary

- The **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** is the time period between entering a scope and initializing a variable with `let` or `const`.
- Variables in the TDZ cannot be accessed and trying to do so will throw a **ReferenceError**.
- The TDZ prevents usage of uninitialized variables and helps ensure safer code execution by enforcing proper initialization before usage.

### **73. What are the differences between synchronous and asynchronous programming?**

**Explanation:**

- **Synchronous Programming:**

  - **Characteristics:** Operations are executed sequentially, blocking subsequent operations until the current one completes.
  - **Usage:** Simple scenarios where operations depend on each other and timing is crucial.

- **Asynchronous Programming:**
  - **Characteristics:** Operations can be executed independently, allowing other operations to proceed without waiting for the current one to complete.
  - **Usage:** Scenarios involving I/O operations, network requests, or tasks that may take an unpredictable amount of time.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
// Synchronous
console.log("Start");
console.log("End");

// Asynchronous
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Middle"), 1000);
console.log("End");
```

**Explanation:**

- **Synchronous programming** is simpler but can be inefficient, while **asynchronous programming** provides better performance and responsiveness for tasks that involve waiting or delays.

---

### **74. What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

- **`null`:** Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to initialize variables with no value.

- **`undefined`:** Indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It is also the default return value of functions that do not explicitly return anything.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
let a = null;
let b;

console.log(a); // Outputs: null
console.log(b); // Outputs: undefined
```

**Explanation:**

- **`null`** and **`undefined`** are distinct values in JavaScript, with **`null`** representing a deliberate lack of value and **`undefined`** indicating that a variable has not been initialized.

### **75. What is Cascade rule and !important keyword in css.**

**Explanation:**
In CSS, the **cascade rule** and the **`!important` keyword** are key concepts that determine how styles are applied to elements when there are conflicting rules. Understanding them helps you resolve style conflicts and apply the desired styling effectively.

### 1. **Cascade Rule in CSS**

The **cascade rule** in CSS refers to the way styles are applied when multiple CSS rules target the same HTML element. The term "cascade" describes the process of choosing which rule wins when multiple conflicting rules are applied to an element.

CSS follows three main factors to determine the style priority:

#### A. **Source Order (Last Rule Wins)**

If two or more rules have the same specificity and importance, the **last rule** written in the code will be applied. This is because CSS reads from top to bottom and the last rule "wins."

```html
<style>
  p {
    color: red;
  }
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

<p>This paragraph will be blue.</p>
```

In this case, both rules have the same specificity, but the second rule (color: blue) is applied because it's written last.

#### B. **Specificity**

Specificity determines which rule is stronger based on how the selectors are written. The more specific a selector is, the higher its precedence.

- **Element selectors** (e.g., `p`, `div`) have the lowest specificity.
- **Class selectors** (e.g., `.class-name`) have higher specificity than elements.
- **ID selectors** (e.g., `#id-name`) have the highest specificity among the three.

```html
<style>
  p {
    color: red; /* Lowest specificity */
  }
  .my-class {
    color: blue; /* Higher specificity */
  }
  #my-id {
    color: green; /* Highest specificity */
  }
</style>

<p id="my-id" class="my-class">This paragraph will be green.</p>
```

Here, the `#my-id` selector is the most specific, so its style (green) is applied to the paragraph, even though there are conflicting styles.

#### C. **Inline Styles**

Styles written directly in the HTML element using the `style` attribute always have higher specificity than styles in the CSS file.

```html
<p id="my-id" style="color: orange;">This paragraph will be orange.</p>
```

In this case, even though the `#my-id` selector has high specificity, the inline style (`style="color: orange;"`) wins because it’s the most specific.

#### Order of Precedence in CSS:

1. **Inline styles** (highest priority)
2. **ID selectors**
3. **Class, attribute, and pseudo-class selectors**
4. **Element and pseudo-element selectors** (lowest priority)
5. **Universal selector (`*`) and inherited styles**

### 2. **The `!important` Keyword**

The `!important` keyword is used to **override** the normal specificity rules in CSS. When `!important` is added to a CSS declaration, that style will take precedence over all others, regardless of specificity or the order of the rules.

#### Example of `!important` Usage:

```html
<style>
  p {
    color: red !important;
  }
  #my-id {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

<p id="my-id">This paragraph will be red.</p>
```

- Even though the `#my-id` selector is more specific, the `!important` keyword applied to `color: red` makes it win, and the paragraph will be red.

### Key Points about `!important`:

- **Overrides specificity**: `!important` will override all other rules, regardless of their specificity or order.
- **Source order still matters** when multiple `!important` rules are present. The last `!important` rule will win if more than one rule applies to the same property.

```html
<style>
  p {
    color: red !important;
  }
  #my-id {
    color: blue !important;
  }
</style>

<p id="my-id">This paragraph will be blue.</p>
```

Here, both rules have `!important`, but the rule for `#my-id` comes later, so the paragraph will be blue.

#### Proper Usage of `!important`

- Use `!important` sparingly. Overusing it can make your CSS hard to maintain because it overrides the natural flow of specificity and makes future debugging difficult.
- It's often a good idea to refactor CSS rather than rely on `!important`. Use it as a last resort when other methods fail.

### Summary

- **Cascade Rule**: CSS applies styles based on **specificity**, **source order**, and the **origin** of the styles. More specific rules or those defined later override others.
- **`!important` Keyword**: This forces a rule to override all others, even those with higher specificity or inline styles, except other `!important` rules, where the last one takes precedence.

Understanding these concepts will help you manage CSS conflicts more effectively and ensure that the right styles are applied where needed.

### **76. What is mutation observer in JavaScript?**

**Mutation Observers** in JavaScript provide a way to monitor changes in the DOM (Document Object Model) and react to them in real-time. A **MutationObserver** allows developers to observe changes to elements like adding or removing child nodes, attribute changes, or text content changes. This is particularly useful when working with dynamic web applications where the DOM is frequently updated.

### Key Features of Mutation Observers:

- **Efficient DOM monitoring**: Mutation observers are more efficient than traditional DOM events like `DOMSubtreeModified` and `DOMNodeInserted`, which are considered deprecated.
- **Asynchronous execution**: Mutation observers run asynchronously, meaning the callback function is executed after all the current tasks and microtasks (like promises) have been completed.
- **Fine control**: You can specify exactly what types of mutations to observe, such as changes to child elements, attributes, or text content.

### Basic Syntax

The `MutationObserver` API has two primary components:

1. **Creating an observer**: You create a mutation observer object using the `MutationObserver` constructor and pass a callback function that will be triggered when mutations occur.
2. **Observing changes**: You use the `.observe()` method to start observing a specific DOM node for the specified mutations.

### Example of MutationObserver:

```javascript
// Define a callback function that is executed when mutations are observed
const observerCallback = function (mutationsList, observer) {
  // Loop through all the mutations
  mutationsList.forEach((mutation) => {
    console.log(mutation.type); // Logs the type of mutation
    if (mutation.type === "childList") {
      console.log("Child nodes changed.");
    } else if (mutation.type === "attributes") {
      console.log("Attributes changed: ", mutation.attributeName);
    }
  });
};

// Create a new MutationObserver and pass the callback function
const observer = new MutationObserver(observerCallback);

// Target DOM node to observe
const targetNode = document.getElementById("my-element");

// Configuration object to specify what changes to observe
const config = {
  childList: true, // Observe addition or removal of child nodes
  attributes: true, // Observe attribute changes
  subtree: true, // Observe changes to all descendants of the target
};

// Start observing the target node
observer.observe(targetNode, config);

// Example mutation: Add a new child element
const newElement = document.createElement("p");
newElement.textContent = "I am a new element!";
targetNode.appendChild(newElement);
```

### Breakdown of the Example:

1. **Callback function**: The `observerCallback` function will be called whenever a mutation (such as adding a child or changing an attribute) is detected. It receives two parameters:

   - **mutationsList**: An array of `MutationRecord` objects, each representing a mutation.
   - **observer**: The `MutationObserver` instance observing the DOM.

2. **Creating an observer**: The `MutationObserver()` constructor takes the callback function as an argument.

3. **Start observing**: The `.observe()` method starts observing the target DOM node (`targetNode` in this case) for the specified changes, defined in the `config` object.

4. **Mutation example**: In this example, a new `<p>` element is appended to `targetNode`, which triggers the mutation observer callback.

### Types of Mutations that Can Be Observed

You can configure a `MutationObserver` to monitor different types of DOM mutations:

1. **`childList`**: Detects when child nodes (elements or text) are added or removed.
2. **`attributes`**: Detects when attributes of an element are modified.
3. **`subtree`**: Detects changes not only in the target element but also in its child elements.
4. **`characterData`**: Detects changes to the text content of the observed node.

### MutationObserver Options (Config Object)

The config object passed to `.observe()` can include the following options:

- **`childList`**: Set to `true` to observe additions or removals of child nodes.
- **`attributes`**: Set to `true` to observe changes to the attributes of the observed node.
- **`subtree`**: Set to `true` to observe changes to the target node and all of its descendants.
- **`characterData`**: Set to `true` to observe changes to the node’s text content.
- **`attributeFilter`**: An array of attribute names to observe for changes. If omitted, all attributes are observed.
- **`attributeOldValue`**: Set to `true` to record the previous value of attributes.
- **`characterDataOldValue`**: Set to `true` to record the previous value of text content.

### Example: Observing Attribute Changes

```javascript
const targetNode = document.getElementById("my-element");

const observer = new MutationObserver((mutationsList) => {
  mutationsList.forEach((mutation) => {
    if (mutation.type === "attributes") {
      console.log(`Attribute "${mutation.attributeName}" was modified.`);
    }
  });
});

const config = { attributes: true };

observer.observe(targetNode, config);

// Example: Changing an attribute
targetNode.setAttribute("class", "new-class");
```

This will log the change whenever the `class` attribute of `targetNode` is modified.

### Stopping the Observer

To stop observing mutations, you can call the `disconnect()` method on the observer:

```javascript
observer.disconnect();
```

### Real-World Use Cases for Mutation Observers

- **Dynamic content loading**: Detect when new content is added to the DOM (e.g., infinite scrolling or dynamically loaded content).
- **Form validation**: Observe changes to form elements to validate input fields dynamically.
- **UI interactions**: Track changes in a specific part of the UI to trigger actions (e.g., hide/show elements, modify layout).
- **Custom components**: Build custom components or frameworks that respond to DOM updates.

### Limitations

- Mutation observers are **asynchronous** and can be **performance-intensive** if used excessively, especially with large DOM trees.
- They do not capture changes made to non-DOM-related actions, such as CSS properties, unless those changes affect the attributes of elements.

### Summary

- **Mutation Observers** are used to track changes to the DOM in an efficient way.
- They can observe a wide variety of mutations, including changes to child nodes, attributes, and text content.
- They are highly customizable through the configuration options and can be used for various tasks like dynamic content handling or DOM manipulation monitoring.
- Unlike older DOM mutation events, Mutation Observers are modern and performant.

### **77. What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

The **`this`** keyword refers to the context in which a function or method is executed. Its value depends on how the function is called.

- **Global Context:** In the global execution context, `this` refers to the global object (e.g., `window` in browsers).
- **Object Methods:** In methods, `this` refers to the object the method is called on.
- **Constructor Functions:** In constructors, `this` refers to the newly created instance.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  greet: function () {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
  },
};

person.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, Alice
```

**Explanation:**

- **`this`** provides context-specific access to properties and methods, enabling dynamic behavior based on the execution context.

---

### **78. How does event delegation work in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

**Event delegation** involves attaching a single event listener to a parent element that handles events for multiple child elements. This technique leverages event bubbling to manage events efficiently.

- **Advantages:**
  - **Performance:** Reduces the number of event listeners, improving performance.
  - **Dynamic Content:** Handles events for dynamically added elements.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  if (event.target && event.target.matches("button.child")) {
    console.log("Child button clicked");
  }
});
```

**Explanation:**

- **Event delegation** improves performance and flexibility by using a single event listener on a parent element to manage events for its child elements.

---

### **79. Difference between Object bracket notation and dot notation**

In JavaScript, objects can be accessed and manipulated using two different syntaxes: **dot notation** and **bracket notation**. Both are used to access or set properties on an object, but they differ in flexibility and usage scenarios.

### 1. **Dot Notation**

Dot notation is the simpler and more commonly used way to access properties in an object. It uses a dot (`.`) followed by the property name.

#### Syntax:

```javascript
object.property;
```

#### Example:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};

console.log(person.name); // "John"
person.age = 31;
console.log(person.age); // 31
```

### Rules and Limitations of Dot Notation:

- **Property names must be valid JavaScript identifiers** (i.e., no spaces, special characters, or starting with a number). For example:

  ```javascript
  const obj = { "first name": "John" };
  console.log(obj.first name); // SyntaxError
  ```

- **The property name must be known and fixed** at the time of coding. You cannot dynamically access a property name with a variable using dot notation.
  ```javascript
  const propertyName = "name";
  console.log(person.propertyName); // undefined
  ```

### 2. **Bracket Notation**

Bracket notation allows you to access properties using **string keys**. It is more flexible because you can dynamically determine the property name at runtime.

#### Syntax:

```javascript
object["property"];
```

#### Example:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};

console.log(person["name"]); // "John"
person["age"] = 31;
console.log(person["age"]); // 31
```

### Flexibility of Bracket Notation:

- **Dynamic property access**: You can use variables or expressions inside the brackets to access a property dynamically.

  ```javascript
  const key = "name";
  console.log(person[key]); // "John"
  ```

- **Property names with spaces or special characters**: If a property has spaces, special characters, or numbers at the beginning, you must use bracket notation.

  ```javascript
  const obj = {
    "first name": "John",
    "@age": 30,
    "123status": "active",
  };

  console.log(obj["first name"]); // "John"
  console.log(obj["@age"]); // 30
  console.log(obj["123status"]); // "active"
  ```

### Key Differences

| Aspect             | Dot Notation                                                                       | Bracket Notation                                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Syntax**         | `object.property`                                                                  | `object["property"]`                                                 |
| **Property Names** | Must be valid identifiers (no spaces, special characters, or numbers at the start) | Can be any string, including those with spaces or special characters |
| **Dynamic Access** | Cannot dynamically access properties                                               | Can dynamically access properties using variables or expressions     |
| **Readability**    | More concise and readable                                                          | Slightly more verbose but more flexible                              |
| **When to Use**    | When property names are known and simple                                           | When property names are dynamic or contain special characters        |

### Example: Dynamic Property Access

If you need to access properties dynamically using a variable, bracket notation is required:

```javascript
const property = "name";
console.log(person[property]); // "John"
```

Dot notation would not work in this case:

```javascript
console.log(person.property); // undefined
```

### Example: Accessing Properties with Special Characters or Spaces

```javascript
const obj = {
  "first name": "Alice",
  "favorite-color": "blue"
};

// Bracket notation
console.log(obj["first name"]); // "Alice"
console.log(obj["favorite-color"]); // "blue"

// Dot notation would throw an error or not work correctly
console.log(obj.first name); // SyntaxError
console.log(obj.favorite-color); // ReferenceError
```

### Summary:

- **Dot notation** is simpler and preferred when property names are valid identifiers.
- **Bracket notation** is more flexible, allowing dynamic access and handling of property names with spaces, special characters, or numbers.

### **80. What is Callback hell in Js ?**

Got it! Let’s break down **callback hell** in a concise but detailed way.

### What is Callback Hell?

Callback hell occurs when multiple asynchronous operations are nested inside each other using callbacks, leading to deeply indented and hard-to-read code, often called the **"Pyramid of Doom"**.

### Why it Happens:

In JavaScript, many operations like fetching data from an API or reading files are asynchronous. When you chain these operations with callbacks (functions executed after the asynchronous task completes), the nesting can get out of hand.

### Example of Callback Hell:

```javascript
asyncOperation1(function (result1) {
  asyncOperation2(result1, function (result2) {
    asyncOperation3(result2, function (result3) {
      asyncOperation4(result3, function (result4) {
        // Final operation
      });
    });
  });
});
```

This code quickly becomes difficult to understand and maintain, especially with error handling or more logic added inside each callback.

### Problems with Callback Hell:

1. **Hard to read**: Deep nesting makes the code complex.
2. **Difficult to maintain**: Modifying such code requires careful attention to every level.
3. **Error handling is complex**: Handling errors for each nested callback becomes tricky.

### Solutions to Avoid Callback Hell:

1. **Promises**: Promises flatten the structure, improving readability.

   ```javascript
   asyncOperation1()
     .then((result1) => asyncOperation2(result1))
     .then((result2) => asyncOperation3(result2))
     .then((result3) => asyncOperation4(result3))
     .catch((error) => console.error(error));
   ```

2. **`async`/`await`**: Even simpler, making asynchronous code look synchronous.
   ```javascript
   async function runOperations() {
     try {
       const result1 = await asyncOperation1();
       const result2 = await asyncOperation2(result1);
       const result3 = await asyncOperation3(result2);
       await asyncOperation4(result3);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(error);
     }
   }
   ```

### Summary:

- **Callback hell** happens when asynchronous callbacks are deeply nested, leading to unreadable and hard-to-maintain code.
- **Promises** and **`async`/`await`** are modern solutions that help avoid callback hell by making asynchronous code easier to manage and read.

---

### **81. What is the purpose of the `constructor` method in a class in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

The **`constructor`** method is a special method for creating and initializing objects created within a class.

- **Usage:** It is called when a new instance of the class is created, allowing for setting up initial properties and performing setup operations.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

const person = new Person("John");
console.log(person.name); // Outputs: John
```

**Explanation:**

- The **`constructor`** method initializes new objects and sets up necessary properties, ensuring proper object creation.

---

### **82. How do JavaScript modules work?**

**Explanation:**

**JavaScript modules** allow code to be divided into smaller, reusable pieces. Modules can export functionality and import it into other modules.

- **`export` Statement:** Exposes functions, objects, or values to other modules.
- **`import` Statement:** Imports functionality from other modules.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
// module.js
export const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}`;

// main.js
import { greet } from "./module.js";
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Outputs: Hello, Alice
```

**Explanation:**

- **JavaScript modules** enable better code organization and reuse, promoting maintainability and scalability in applications.

---

### **83. What is the `spread` operator and its uses in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

The **`spread` operator** (`...`) is used to expand or spread elements of an iterable (e.g., array) into individual elements.

- **Usage Examples:**
  - **Arrays:** Copying and merging arrays.
  - **Function Calls:** Passing arguments to functions.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const moreNumbers = [...numbers, 4, 5];
console.log(moreNumbers); // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const add = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
const args = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(add(...args)); // Outputs: 6
```

**Explanation:**

- The **`spread` operator** simplifies working with arrays and function arguments by expanding iterables into individual elements.

---

### **84. What are arrow functions, and how do they differ from regular functions?**

**Explanation:**

**Arrow functions** provide a more concise syntax for writing functions and have different behavior for the `this` keyword.

- **Syntax:**

  ```javascript
  const add = (a, b) => a + b;
  ```

- **Differences from Regular Functions:**
  - **No `this` Binding:** Arrow functions do not have their own `this`; they inherit it from the surrounding context.
  - **No `arguments` Object:** Arrow functions do not have their own `arguments` object.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const obj = {
  value: 10,
  getValue: function () {
    return (() => this.value)();
  },
};

console.log(obj.getValue()); // Outputs: 10
```

**Explanation:**

- **Arrow functions** offer a more concise syntax and different behavior for `this`, making them useful for specific contexts and situations.

---

### **85. How do `map` and `filter` methods work in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

- **`map`:** Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map((x) => x * 2);
console.log(doubled); // Outputs: [2, 4, 6]
```

- **`filter`:** Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const even = numbers.filter((x) => x % 2 === 0);
console.log(even); // Outputs: [2]
```

**Explanation:**

- **`map`** and **`filter`** methods provide powerful ways to transform and filter arrays, enabling more functional programming techniques in JavaScript.

---

### **86. What is the purpose of `async` and `await` in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

Absolutely! Here's a clear and concise explanation:

### **`setTimeout` vs. `setInterval`**

- **`setTimeout`**:

  - **Function**: Executes a function **once** after a specified delay.
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Executed after 2 seconds");
    }, 2000);
    ```

- **`setInterval`**:
  - **Function**: Repeatedly executes a function every specified interval.
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    setInterval(() => {
      console.log("Executed every 2 seconds");
    }, 2000);
    ```

### **`clearTimeout` vs. `clearInterval`**

- **`clearTimeout`**:

  - **Function**: Cancels a timeout created with `setTimeout`.
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    const timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
      /* ... */
    }, 2000);
    clearTimeout(timeoutID); // Cancels the timeout
    ```

- **`clearInterval`**:
  - **Function**: Stops an interval created with `setInterval`.
  - **Usage**:
    ```javascript
    const intervalID = setInterval(() => {
      /* ... */
    }, 2000);
    clearInterval(intervalID); // Stops the interval
    ```

### Summary:

- **`setTimeout`** runs code once after a delay; **`setInterval`** runs code repeatedly at intervals.
- **`clearTimeout`** stops a scheduled single execution; **`clearInterval`** stops ongoing repeated executions.

---

### **87. How does event delegation improve performance in web applications?**

**Explanation:**

**Event delegation** improves performance by:

- **Reducing the Number of Event Listeners:** Attaches a single event listener to a parent element instead of multiple listeners to individual child elements.
- **Handling Dynamic Content:** Works for dynamically added elements without needing to attach new event listeners.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  if (event.target && event.target.matches("button.child")) {
    console.log("Child button clicked");
  }
});
```

**Explanation:**

- **Event delegation** reduces overhead and improves performance by managing events efficiently and accommodating dynamically changing content.

---

### **88. What are the benefits and limitations of using `localStorage` in web applications?**

**Explanation:**

**Benefits of `localStorage`:**

- **Persistent Storage:** Data persists even after the browser is closed.
- **Simple API:** Easy to use with a straightforward key-value storage mechanism.

**Limitations of `localStorage`:**

- **Size Limitation:** Typically limited to around 5-10MB per origin.
- **No Expiry:** Data does not automatically expire, which might lead to outdated or stale data.
- **Security Concerns:** Data stored in `localStorage` is accessible through JavaScript and can be vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
console.log(localStorage.getItem("key")); // Outputs: value
```

**Explanation:**

- **`localStorage`** is useful for persistent storage but comes with limitations and security considerations that should be taken into account.

---

### **89. what atob() method do in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

The `atob` function in JavaScript is used to **decode** a Base64-encoded string back into its original ASCII string format. "Base64" is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a base64 representation.

### **Usage of `atob`**

- **Purpose**: Decodes Base64-encoded strings.
- **Syntax**:
  ```javascript
  atob(encodedString);
  ```
- **Example**:

  ```javascript
  // Base64-encoded string (for "Hello, World!")
  const encoded = "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==";

  // Decoding it
  const decoded = atob(encoded);

  console.log(decoded); // "Hello, World!"
  ```

### Key Points:

- **Input**: The input to `atob` must be a valid Base64-encoded string.
- **Output**: It returns a string decoded from Base64. The resulting string is in the same format as the original string before encoding.

### Note:

- `atob` works with **ASCII** strings. If you need to handle binary data or Unicode strings, you might need additional encoding/decoding steps.
- For more complex cases involving non-ASCII characters, you might use `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` for better support.

```javascript
// Example with UTF-8 encoded Base64 string
const encodedUTF8 = "5L2g5aW977yM5LiW55WM"; // Base64 for "Hello world"
const decodedUTF8 = atob(encodedUTF8);

console.log(decodedUTF8); // "Hello world"
```

### Summary:

- **`atob`** decodes Base64-encoded strings into their original ASCII format. Use it when you need to convert Base64 data back into readable text.

### **90. $group() method in mongoose ?**

The **`group`** method in Mongoose (and MongoDB) is used to perform aggregation operations that group documents together based on a specific key and apply aggregation functions to the grouped documents. It’s part of MongoDB’s aggregation framework, which provides powerful tools for data processing and analysis.

### **Using `group` in Mongoose**

**Note**: The `group` method is deprecated and replaced by the aggregation framework's `$group` stage. You should use the `$group` stage in the aggregation pipeline instead. Below is a general explanation of how to use `$group` in Mongoose.

### **Aggregation Pipeline with `$group`**

The `$group` stage in an aggregation pipeline allows you to group documents by a specific field and perform various operations on the grouped data, such as counting, summing, or averaging.

#### **Basic Syntax:**

```javascript
Model.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$fieldName", // Group by this field
      total: { $sum: 1 }, // Example aggregation operation (count)
      // other aggregations like $avg, $max, $min, etc.
    },
  },
]);
```

### **Example Usage:**

Assume you have a collection of `orders` and you want to group them by the `status` field and count the number of orders for each status.

#### **Schema Example:**

```javascript
const orderSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  status: String,
  amount: Number,
});

const Order = mongoose.model("Order", orderSchema);
```

#### **Aggregation Query:**

```javascript
Order.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$status", // Group by the 'status' field
      count: { $sum: 1 }, // Count the number of documents in each group
    },
  },
])
  .then((results) => {
    console.log(results);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
  });
```

#### **Output:**

```json
[
  { "_id": "pending", "count": 10 },
  { "_id": "shipped", "count": 20 },
  { "_id": "delivered", "count": 15 }
]
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **`$group`**: Groups the documents by the field specified in `_id`. Here, `"_id": "$status"` means grouping by the `status` field.

2. **Aggregation Operations**:
   - **`$sum`**: Counts the number of documents in each group. Here, `{ $sum: 1 }` increments the count for each document.

### **Additional Aggregation Operators:**

- **`$avg`**: Computes the average of a numeric field.
- **`$max`**: Finds the maximum value of a field.
- **`$min`**: Finds the minimum value of a field.
- **`$push`**: Creates an array of field values.
- **`$addToSet`**: Creates an array of unique field values.

### **Summary:**

- **`$group`** in the aggregation pipeline is used to group documents and perform aggregation operations like counting, summing, and averaging.
- **`$group`** replaces the deprecated `group` method and is a key component of MongoDB’s powerful aggregation framework.

### **91. What is the `new` keyword used for in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

The **`new`** keyword is used to create instances of user-defined objects or built-in objects that have a constructor function.

- **Usage:**
  - **Create Instances:** Instantiate new objects with a constructor.
  - **Set Up Context:** Automatically sets the context (`this`) within the constructor function.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

const person = new Person("Alice");
console.log(person.name); // Outputs: Alice
```

**Explanation:**

- **`new`** initializes new instances and sets up the context for constructors, enabling object creation and initialization.

---

### **92. How do `try...catch` blocks work in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

**`try...catch`** blocks are used to handle exceptions and errors that occur during the execution of code.

- **`try` Block:** Contains code that may throw an error.
- **`catch` Block:** Contains code that handles the error if one occurs.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
try {
  let result = riskyFunction();
} catch (error) {
  console.error("An error occurred:", error);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`try...catch`** provides a way to handle errors gracefully, allowing the program to continue running even if an error occurs.

---

### **93. What is the `prototype` property in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

The **`prototype`** property allows for the inheritance of properties and methods from one object to another.

- **Usage:**
  - **Add Methods:** Add methods to constructor functions or classes.
  - **Inheritance:** Enable object inheritance and method sharing.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function () {
  return `Hello, ${this.name}`;
};

const person = new Person("Alice");
console.log(person.greet()); // Outputs: Hello, Alice
```

**Explanation:**

- The **`prototype`** property provides a mechanism for defining and sharing methods across instances, enabling inheritance and code reuse.

---

### **94. What is the `this` context in arrow functions?**

**Explanation:**

In **arrow functions**, **`this`** does not have its own context; instead, it inherits the `this` value from the surrounding lexical context.

- **Usage:**
  - **Inherit `this`:** Useful in scenarios where `this` needs to refer to the surrounding context.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
function Timer() {
  this.seconds = 0;
  setInterval(() => {
    this.seconds++;
    console.log(this.seconds);
  }, 1000);
}

const timer = new Timer();
```

**Explanation:**

- **Arrow functions** inherit `this` from their enclosing scope, avoiding issues with `this` binding in traditional functions.

---

### **95. exec() method in mongoose.**

The `.exec()` method in Mongoose is used to execute a query and return a promise, which allows for asynchronous handling of the query result. It is commonly used in combination with Mongoose query methods like `.find()`, `.findOne()`, `.findById()`, etc.

### **How `.exec()` Works:**

- **Purpose**: Executes a Mongoose query and returns a promise.
- **Usage**: It is used when you want to handle the result of a query using `.then()` and `.catch()` for promise chaining, or `async/await` syntax.

### **Basic Syntax:**

```javascript
Model.find(query)
  .exec()
  .then((result) => {
    // Handle the result
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // Handle errors
  });
```

### **Example Usage:**

Assuming you have a `User` model and you want to find users with a specific age:

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

// Define a simple User schema
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
});

const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);

// Query to find users with age 30
User.find({ age: 30 })
  .exec()
  .then((users) => {
    console.log(users); // Array of users with age 30
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(err); // Handle error
  });
```

### **With `async/await`:**

You can also use `.exec()` with `async/await` for cleaner and more readable code:

```javascript
async function findUsers() {
  try {
    const users = await User.find({ age: 30 }).exec();
    console.log(users); // Array of users with age 30
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err); // Handle error
  }
}

findUsers();
```

### **Key Points:**

- **Promise-Based**: `.exec()` returns a promise, allowing you to use promise methods (`.then()`, `.catch()`) or `async/await`.
- **Error Handling**: `.exec()` helps in managing errors gracefully using promises.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Using `.exec()` can help separate query construction from execution, which can be useful for more complex query setups.

### **Summary:**

- **`.exec()`** executes a Mongoose query and returns a promise, making it easy to handle asynchronous operations using promises or `async/await`.
- It allows for flexible and clean error handling and result management in Mongoose queries.

### **96. How can we schedule any operation in nodejs application, for example we wanted to schedule the account deletion in a web application?**

**Explanation:**

In Node.js or Express.js, you can schedule operations using several approaches. For scheduling tasks like account deletion, you can use built-in modules, third-party libraries, or task schedulers. Here’s a concise guide on how to do this:

### **1. Using `setTimeout` and `setInterval`**

- **`setTimeout`**: Executes a function once after a specified delay.
- **`setInterval`**: Repeatedly executes a function at specified intervals.

**Example**:

```javascript
// Schedule a task to run once after 24 hours
const millisecondsInADay = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
setTimeout(() => {
  // Your code to delete the account
  console.log("Account deletion executed");
}, millisecondsInADay);
```

**Limitations**:

- Not suitable for long-term or recurring tasks as the Node.js process needs to be running continuously.

### **2. Using Third-Party Libraries**

**a. `node-cron`**

`node-cron` is a popular library for scheduling tasks using cron syntax.

- **Installation**:

  ```bash
  npm install node-cron
  ```

- **Usage**:

  ```javascript
  const cron = require("node-cron");

  // Schedule a task to run daily at midnight
  cron.schedule("0 0 * * *", () => {
    // Your code to delete accounts
    console.log("Scheduled account deletion executed");
  });
  ```

**b. `agenda`**

`agenda` is a more robust task scheduler for Node.js.

- **Installation**:

  ```bash
  npm install agenda
  ```

- **Usage**:

  ```javascript
  const Agenda = require("agenda");
  const mongoConnectionString = "mongodb://localhost/agenda";
  const agenda = new Agenda({ db: { address: mongoConnectionString } });

  // Define a job
  agenda.define("delete account", async (job) => {
    // Your code to delete accounts
    console.log("Account deletion job executed");
  });

  (async function () {
    // Schedule the job to run daily
    await agenda.start();
    await agenda.every("24 hours", "delete account");
  })();
  ```

### **3. Using Task Queues**

**a. `Bull`**

`Bull` is a powerful library for managing job queues and scheduling tasks.

- **Installation**:

  ```bash
  npm install bull
  ```

- **Usage**:

  ```javascript
  const Bull = require("bull");
  const accountDeletionQueue = new Bull(
    "accountDeletionQueue",
    "redis://localhost:6379"
  );

  // Define a job
  accountDeletionQueue.process(async (job) => {
    // Your code to delete accounts
    console.log("Account deletion job executed");
  });

  // Schedule a job to run after 24 hours
  accountDeletionQueue.add({}, { delay: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 });
  ```

### **4. Using External Services**

**a. Heroku Scheduler**: If you're using Heroku, you can use the Heroku Scheduler add-on to run tasks at scheduled times.

**b. AWS Lambda and CloudWatch**: AWS Lambda can be used in combination with CloudWatch Events to schedule tasks.

### **Summary:**

- **For simple tasks**, use `setTimeout` or `setInterval`, but keep in mind they are less reliable for long-term or production use.
- **For more complex scheduling**, use libraries like `node-cron`, `agenda`, or `Bull`, which provide advanced scheduling and job management features.
- **For cloud-based applications**, consider using external services like Heroku Scheduler or AWS Lambda for scheduling tasks.

## Choose the method that best fits your needs based on the complexity and reliability requirements of your scheduled tasks.

const name = "Alice";
const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(message); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

**Explanation:**

- **Template literals** provide a flexible and readable way to handle strings, including multi-line text and embedded expressions.

---

### **99. How does the `default` keyword work in JavaScript functions?**

**Explanation:**

The **`default`** keyword allows setting default values for function parameters when no value is provided.

- **Usage:**
  - **Provide Defaults:** Define default values for parameters in function declarations.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
function greet(name = "Guest") {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
}

greet(); // Outputs: Hello, Guest
greet("Alice"); // Outputs: Hello, Alice
```

**Explanation:**

- **`default`** values simplify function calls by providing fallback values when arguments are not passed.

---

### **100. What is the purpose of the `Symbol` type in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**

**`Symbol`** is a primitive data type used to create unique identifiers for object properties.

- **Usage:**
  - **Unique Keys:** Create unique property keys to avoid collisions.
  - **Well-Known Symbols:** Access built-in symbols for specific behavior (e.g., `Symbol.iterator`).

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const uniqueId = Symbol("id");
const obj = { [uniqueId]: 123 };

console.log(obj[uniqueId]); // Outputs: 123
```

**Explanation:**

- **`Symbol`** provides a way to create unique property keys, ensuring that property names do not conflict and are used for special cases.

---

Yes, I understand! You’re looking for a detailed yet clear explanation with a focus on how the concept is used and an example to illustrate it. Here’s how I’ll approach it for each question:

---

### **101. An array is declared with `const`, yet we are still able to update or reassign it, such as pushing or pulling elements. Why is this possible?**

**Explanation:**

**`const`** in JavaScript ensures that the variable binding (i.e., the reference to the array) cannot be reassigned. However, it does not make the contents of the array immutable. You can still modify the array’s contents, such as adding or removing elements, because these actions do not change the reference but rather alter the data the reference points to.

- **Usage:**
  - **Modify Array Elements:** You can use methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, and `unshift()` to modify the array’s contents.
  - **Reassign Reference:** You cannot reassign `const` declared arrays to a new array.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.push(4); // Modifies the array, not the binding
console.log(numbers); // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Attempting to reassign the array will cause an error
// numbers = [5, 6, 7]; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
```

**Explanation:**

- **`const`** ensures that the array’s reference remains unchanged, but the data within the array can still be altered. This is useful for maintaining a consistent reference while allowing data modifications.

---

### **102. Why do we require `express-session`, and what does it do?**

**Explanation:**

**`express-session`** is middleware for Express.js applications that handles session management. Sessions are used to store user-specific data across multiple HTTP requests. This middleware helps maintain a stateful session for each user by storing session data on the server and identifying users via a session ID cookie.

- **Usage:**
  - **Manage Sessions:** Track user sessions and store data like user preferences or authentication status.
  - **Session ID Cookies:** Issue cookies to clients that include a session ID to identify users across requests.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const session = require("express-session");
const app = express();

app.use(
  session({
    secret: "your-secret-key", // Used to sign the session ID cookie
    resave: false, // Save session even if unmodified
    saveUninitialized: true, // Save new sessions
    cookie: { secure: false }, // Set to true if using HTTPS
  })
);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  if (!req.session.views) {
    req.session.views = 1;
  } else {
    req.session.views++;
  }
  res.send(`Number of views: ${req.session.views}`);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Explanation:**

- **`express-session`** allows you to store and manage user-specific data across multiple requests, providing a way to maintain user state in a web application.

---

### **103. What is HLS, and what is the role of `.m3u8` files in HLS?**

**Explanation:**

**HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)** is a protocol for streaming audio and video content over HTTP. It breaks media content into small segments and delivers them sequentially. The `.m3u8` files are playlist files that describe the sequence of media segments and other metadata required for playback.

- **Usage:**
  - **Stream Media:** Deliver video or audio content over the web.
  - **Playlist Management:** `.m3u8` files list URLs of media segments and provide metadata for media playback.

**Usage Example:**

An `.m3u8` playlist file might look like this:

```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10
#EXTINF:10.0,
http://example.com/segment1.ts
#EXTINF:10.0,
http://example.com/segment2.ts
```

**Explanation:**

- **HLS** enables efficient streaming by dividing media into segments and using playlists (`.m3u8` files) to manage these segments, ensuring smooth playback over HTTP.

---

### **104. What is the `child_process` library in Node.js, and what are its methods, specifically `stdout` and `stderr`?**

**Explanation:**

**`child_process`** is a built-in Node.js module that allows you to create and manage child processes. These processes run concurrently with the main process and can execute system commands or scripts. The `stdout` and `stderr` properties represent the standard output and error streams of the child process, respectively.

- **Usage:**
  - **Execute Commands:** Run system commands or external scripts.
  - **Handle Output:** Access and handle output and error data from child processes.

**Usage Example:**

- **Buffers:** Buffers are temporary storage areas used to hold binary data while it is being processed. They provide a way to work with raw data.

- **Usage:**
  - **Streams:** Handle large files or real-time data processing.
  - **Buffers:** Work with binary data, such as reading files or network communication.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

// Reading a file as a stream
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("example.txt");
readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);
});

// Using Buffer
const buffer = Buffer.from("Hello World");
console.log(buffer.toString()); // Outputs: Hello World
```

**Explanation:**

- **Streams** and **buffers** are used for efficient data handling in Node.js, with streams managing continuous data flow and buffers working with raw binary data.

---

### **108. How can threading be managed and stopped in Node.js?**

**Explanation:**

Node.js handles threading through the `worker_threads` module, which allows running JavaScript code in parallel threads. You can manage threads using `Worker` objects and terminate them using the `terminate()` method.

- **Usage:**
  - **Create Workers:** Use `new Worker()` to start new threads.
  - **Terminate Workers:** Use the `terminate()` method to stop threads.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require("worker_threads");

if (isMainThread) {
  const worker = new Worker(__filename);
  worker.on("message", (message) => console.log(message));
  worker.postMessage("Hello, worker!");
} else {
  parentPort.on("message", (message) => {
    parentPort.postMessage(`Received message: ${message}`);
  });
}
```

- **Usage:**
  - **Export Modules:** Use `module.exports` to export functionality from a module.
  - **Require Modules:** Use `require()` to import and use modules in other files.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
// In math.js
module.exports.add = (a, b) => a + b;

// In app.js
const math = require("./math");
console.log(math.add(2, 3)); // Outputs: 5
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node.js manages modules** using the CommonJS system, allowing code to be modular and reusable through export and import functionality.

---

### **111. How is the Node.js event loop different from the event loop in browsers?**

**Explanation:**

- **Node.js Event Loop:** Handles asynchronous I/O operations and callbacks using a single-threaded event loop. It uses different phases to process callbacks, I/O operations, and timers.
- **Browser Event Loop:** Also single-threaded but handles user interactions, rendering, and network requests. The browser's event loop integrates with the rendering engine to manage visual updates and animations.

**Usage Example:**

In Node.js:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout!"), 0);
console.log("Log before timeout");
```

In browsers, the event loop integrates with the rendering engine for smooth visual updates.

**Explanation:**

- **Node.js** and **browser event loops** handle asynchronous tasks differently due to their distinct environments and requirements. Node.js focuses on I/O and server-side operations, while browsers manage user interactions and rendering.

---

### **112. What are child processes and parent processes in Node.js?**

**Explanation:**

- **Child Processes:** Processes created by the parent process, typically using the `child_process` module. They can execute system commands or scripts independently.
- **Parent Processes:** The initial process that spawns child processes. It manages and communicates with them.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const { exec } = require("child_process");

**Clustering** in Node.js involves creating multiple instances of the Node.js application to take advantage of multi-core systems. Each instance runs on a separate core, allowing for better load distribution and improved performance.

- **Usage:**
  - **Distribute Load:** Use clustering to handle more concurrent requests by spreading them across multiple processes.
  - **Improve Performance:** Utilize multi-core CPUs for better application scalability.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const cluster = require("cluster");
const http = require("http");
const numCPUs = require("os").cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  // Fork workers.
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  cluster.on("exit", (worker, code, signal) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
  });
} else {
  http
    .createServer((req, res) => {
      res.writeHead(200);
      res.end("Hello World\n");
    })
    .listen(8000);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Clustering** helps improve the scalability of Node.js applications by leveraging multi-core systems to handle more concurrent requests.

### **116. How is compression handled in Node.js?**

**Explanation:**

**Compression** in Node.js can be managed using middleware like `compression` for Express.js applications. It compresses HTTP responses using gzip or deflate algorithms to reduce the size of data sent over the network.

- **Usage:**
  - **Reduce Response Size:** Use compression to minimize data size, improving load times.
  - **Middleware Integration:** Integrate with Express.js to automatically compress responses.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const compression = require("compression");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(compression());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Explanation:**

- **Compression** reduces the size of HTTP responses, enhancing performance and user experience by decreasing data transfer times.

---

### **117. How does multi-threading work in Node.js?**

**Explanation:**

**Multi-threading** in Node.js is achieved using the `worker_threads` module, which allows running JavaScript code in parallel threads. Node.js itself uses a single-threaded event loop for JavaScript execution but offloads heavy tasks to worker threads.

- **Usage:**
  - **Parallel Execution:** Use worker threads to run tasks in parallel, improving performance for CPU-bound operations.
  - **Thread Management:** Create and manage threads for concurrent execution.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require("worker_threads");

if (isMainThread) {
  const worker = new Worker(__filename);
  worker.on("message", (message) => console.log(message));
  worker.postMessage("Hello, worker!");
} else {
  parentPort.on("message", (message) => {
    parentPort.postMessage(`Received message: ${message}`);
  });
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Multi-threading** in Node.js allows concurrent execution of tasks, making it suitable for handling CPU-intensive operations in parallel with the event loop.

---

### **118. What is cryptography and how are web sockets used in Node.js?**

**Explanation:**

- **Cryptography:** Cryptography involves techniques for securing information through encryption and hashing. In Node.js, the `crypto` module provides methods for these operations, ensuring data privacy and integrity.

- **WebSockets:** WebSockets enable real-time, full-duplex communication between clients and servers. In Node.js, libraries like `ws` facilitate WebSocket connections for real-time data exchange.

- **Usage:**
  - **Cryptography:** Encrypt sensitive data and verify data integrity.
  - **WebSockets:** Implement real-time features like chat applications or live notifications.

**Usage Example (WebSocket Server):**

```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', (ws)

 => {
  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log(`Received message => ${message}`);
  });
  ws.send('Hello! Message From Server!!');
});
```

**Explanation:**

- **Cryptography** ensures data security, while **WebSockets** facilitate real-time communication, making them essential for secure and interactive web applications.

- **Usage:**
  - **Parse Form Data:** Convert URL-encoded form data into a JavaScript object.
  - **Handle POST Requests:** Process form submissions in web applications.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.post("/submit", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // Access form data
  res.send("Form data received");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Explanation:**

- **`express.urlencoded()`** parses URL-encoded data, making form data available in request objects for processing in Express.js applications.

---

### **120. What is EJS?**

  res.render("index", { title: "EJS Example", message: "Hello, EJS!" });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Explanation:**

- **EJS** enables dynamic HTML generation by embedding JavaScript in templates, making it easy to render views with data in Node.js applications.

---

### **121. What is the difference between `cookie-parser` and `body-parser`?**

**Explanation:**

- **`cookie-parser`:** Middleware for parsing cookies attached to requests. It populates `req.cookies` with cookie data.

- **`body-parser`:** Middleware for parsing request bodies. It parses incoming request bodies in various formats, such as JSON and URL-encoded data, and populates `req.body`.

- **Usage:**
  - **`cookie-parser`:** Read cookies from incoming requests.
  - **`body-parser`:** Handle different types of request bodies.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const app = express();

app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.post("/data", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // URL-encoded data
  console.log(req.cookies); // Cookies
  res.send("Data received");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Explanation:**

- **`cookie-parser`** deals with cookies, while **`body-parser`** handles request bodies, making them complementary middleware in Express.js.

---

### ### **122. What are HTTP methods, and what are the differences between POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE?**

**Explanation:**

- **POST:** Submits data to be processed to a specified resource (e.g., form submission).
- **GET:** Requests data from a specified resource (e.g., retrieving a webpage).
- **PUT:** Updates a resource with new data (e.g., updating user information).
- **PATCH:** Partially updates a resource (e.g., updating a single field).
- **DELETE:** Deletes a specified resource (e.g., removing a user).

- **Usage:**
  - **POST:** Create new resources.
  - **GET:** Retrieve resources.
  - **PUT:** Replace existing resources.
  - **PATCH:** Modify parts of existing resources.
  - **DELETE:** Remove resources.

const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.post("/create", (req, res) => res.send("Resource created"));
app.get("/retrieve", (req, res) => res.send("Resource retrieved"));
app.put("/update", (req, res) => res.send("Resource updated"));
app.patch("/modify", (req, res) => res.send("Resource partially updated"));
app.delete("/remove", (req, res) => res.send("Resource deleted"));

app.listen(3000);
```

**Explanation:**

- **HTTP methods** define different types of operations for interacting with resources, with each method serving specific purposes for creating, retrieving, updating, or deleting data.

---

### ### **123. What is `env` and what does the `config()` method do?**

**Explanation:**

**`env`** typically refers to environment variables used to configure applications. The `config()` method is commonly used in libraries like `dotenv` to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

- **Usage:**
  - **`dotenv`:** Load environment variables from a `.env` file.
  - **Environment Variables:** Store configuration data such as database credentials or API keys.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
// .env file
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb

// app.js
require('dotenv').config();
console.log(process.env.DATABASE_URL); // Outputs the database URL from .env file
```

**Explanation:**

- **`env`** provides a way to manage configuration settings securely, while **`config()`** helps load these settings into the application.

---

### **124. What is a Bearer Token?**

**Explanation:**

**Bearer Token** is a type of access token used in authorization headers to access protected resources. It’s included in HTTP requests to verify the identity of the requester.

- **Usage:**
  - **Authenticate Requests:** Use bearer tokens to grant access to APIs or resources.
  - **Authorization Header:** Include the token in the `Authorization` header of HTTP requests.

**Usage Example:**

---

### **127. What is the difference between HTTP request methods ?**

---

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the HTTP request methods: **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **PATCH**, **DELETE**, and others.

---

1.  **GET**
    **Purpose**: Retrieve data from a server.

- **Use case**: When you want to fetch information from a database or API.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Safe**: Does not modify any data.
  - **Idempotent**: Multiple identical requests return the same result.
  - **Cacheable**: Responses can be cached to optimize performance.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  GET /users
  ```
  This might retrieve a list of all users from a server.

2.  **POST**
    **Purpose**: Send data to the server to create or process a resource.

- **Use case**: When submitting a form, uploading a file, or creating a new resource.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Non-idempotent**: Multiple identical requests can create multiple new resources or have different effects.
  - **Not Cacheable**: Responses are usually not cached.
  - **Body Content**: Data is sent in the request body.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  POST /users
  Body: { "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" }
  ```
  This creates a new user with the provided data.

3.  **PUT**
    **Purpose**: Update or replace a resource on the server.

- **Use case**: When you want to completely replace an existing resource or create it if it doesn’t exist.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Idempotent**: Multiple identical requests produce the same result (replaces the resource each time).
  - **Requires Full Data**: Often expects the complete resource data in the request body.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  PUT /users/1
  Body: { "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@newdomain.com" }
  ```
  This replaces the user with `id=1` with the provided data.

4.  **PATCH**
    **Purpose**: Partially update a resource on the server.

- **Use case**: When you want to update only specific fields of an existing resource.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Idempotent**: Like `PUT`, multiple identical `PATCH` requests result in the same updated resource.
  - **Partial Updates**: Only the fields provided in the request body will be updated, leaving the rest untouched.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  PATCH /users/1
  Body: { "email": "john@newdomain.com" }
  ```
  This updates only the email of the user with `id=1`, without changing other data.

5.  **DELETE**
    **Purpose**: Remove a resource from the server.

- **Use case**: When you want to delete a resource.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Idempotent**: After the resource is deleted, subsequent identical requests have no additional effect.
  - **Non-Safe**: Deletes the resource, which is a non-reversible action.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  DELETE /users/1
  ```
  This deletes the user with `id=1`.

---

6.  **HEAD**
    **Purpose**: Same as `GET`, but it only retrieves the headers, not the body of the resource.

- **Use case**: When you want to check the existence or metadata (like content type, length) of a resource without downloading the actual data.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Safe & Idempotent**: Like `GET`, but no response body is returned.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  HEAD /users
  ```

7.  **OPTIONS**
    **Purpose**: Describes the communication options for the target resource.

- **Use case**: To determine which HTTP methods are supported by the server for a specific resource.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Safe & Idempotent**: Does not affect the resource.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  OPTIONS /users
  ```

---

**Comparison Summary:**

| Method      | Usage                     | Safe | Idempotent | Cacheable | Payload/Body |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ---- | ---------- | --------- | ------------ |
| **GET**     | Retrieve a resource       | Yes  | Yes        | Yes       | No           |
| **POST**    | Create a new resource     | No   | No         | No        | Yes          |
| **PUT**     | Replace a resource        | No   | Yes        | No        | Yes          |
| **PATCH**   | Update part of a resource | No   | Yes        | No        | Yes          |
| **DELETE**  | Delete a resource         | No   | Yes        | No        | No           |
| **HEAD**    | Retrieve headers only     | Yes  | Yes        | Yes       | No           |
| **OPTIONS** | Discover allowed methods  | Yes  | Yes        | No        | No           |

---

**Key Points:**

- **GET** is used to retrieve data without making any changes.
- **POST** is used for creating new resources or sending data to the server.
- **PUT** replaces an entire resource, while **PATCH** updates a part of a resource.
- **DELETE** is used to remove a resource.
- **HEAD** and **OPTIONS** are for metadata and server communication, without modifying resources.

Understanding these methods helps in designing APIs that follow REST principles and provides better control over how resources are accessed or modified.

### **128. What is prototype in js?**

---

In JavaScript, **prototypes** are a foundational feature of the language's object-oriented architecture. Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which is another object from which the first object inherits properties and methods.

Here’s a detailed explanation of **prototypes**:

---

1.  **What is a Prototype?**

A **prototype** is essentially a blueprint or a mechanism by which JavaScript objects can inherit properties and methods from another object. When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript will first look for it on the object itself. If it’s not found, it will look at the object's **prototype** to see if the property or method exists there.

---

2.  **Prototype Chain**

JavaScript uses a concept called the **prototype chain**. When a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript looks for it in the object itself. If it’s not found, it goes up the prototype chain and looks at the object’s prototype, and then the prototype of that prototype, and so on, until it reaches the end of the chain (`null`).

For example:

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function () {
  return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`;
};

const john = new Person("John");
console.log(john.greet()); // Output: Hello, my name is John
```

In this example:

- The `greet` method is not directly defined on the `john` object.
- JavaScript looks at the `Person.prototype` object for the `greet` method.
- It finds it and executes it successfully.

---

3.  **Prototype vs `__proto__`**

- **`prototype`**: This is a property of **constructor functions** (like `Person` in the example above) and is used when you create new objects using that constructor function. It defines properties and methods that will be shared across all instances created by that constructor.

  ```js
  function Animal() {}
  console.log(Animal.prototype); // Output: Animal {}
  ```

- **`__proto__`**: This is the **internal prototype** of any given object, which points to the prototype object it inherits from. It's how JavaScript objects are linked in the prototype chain. While it's accessible in many browsers, it's considered a non-standard way of interacting with prototypes.

  ```js
  const obj = {};
  console.log(obj.__proto__); // Output: [Object: null prototype] {}
  ```

  The more standard way to access an object’s prototype is using `Object.getPrototypeOf()`:

  ```js
  const obj = {};
  console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)); // Output: [Object: null prototype] {}
  ```

---

4.  **Inheritance via Prototypes**

Prototypes are key to achieving inheritance in JavaScript. When objects are created, they inherit properties and methods from their prototype. This allows for sharing common functionality between multiple objects without having to duplicate code.

For example:

```js
function Vehicle(type) {
  this.type = type;
}

Vehicle.prototype.start = function () {
  return `${this.type} is starting`;
};

const car = new Vehicle("Car");
const bike = new Vehicle("Bike");

console.log(car.start()); // Output: Car is starting
console.log(bike.start()); // Output: Bike is starting
```

In this case, both `car` and `bike` inherit the `start` method from `Vehicle.prototype`.

---

5.  **Modifying Prototypes**

Prototypes can be modified at runtime. This means that you can add or modify properties and methods in a prototype, and all objects inheriting from that prototype will have access to the updated properties or methods.

For instance:

```js
Vehicle.prototype.stop = function () {
  return `${this.type} is stopping`;
};

console.log(car.stop()); // Output: Car is stopping
console.log(bike.stop()); // Output: Bike is stopping
```

---

6.  **Prototype in Built-in Objects**

JavaScript’s built-in objects (such as arrays, strings, and functions) also have prototypes. For example, when you create an array, it inherits methods like `push()`, `pop()`, and `forEach()` from `Array.prototype`.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(arr.__proto__ === Array.prototype); // Output: true
```

You can even extend or modify the prototypes of built-in objects, although this is generally discouraged because it can lead to unexpected behavior:

```js
Array.prototype.sum = function () {
  return this.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
};

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(numbers.sum()); // Output: 10
```

---

7.  **`Object.prototype`**

All JavaScript objects (except those explicitly created with `Object.create(null)`) inherit from `Object.prototype`. This is the root of the prototype chain, and it provides common methods such as:

- `toString()`
- `hasOwnProperty()`
- `valueOf()`

```js
const obj = {};
console.log(obj.toString()); // Output: [object Object]
```

---

8.  **Prototypal vs Classical Inheritance**

Unlike classical inheritance (used in languages like Java or C++), where classes inherit from other classes, JavaScript uses **prototypal inheritance**, where objects inherit directly from other objects. This makes JavaScript’s inheritance model more flexible.

---

**Conclusion**

In JavaScript:

- Every object has a prototype, which is another object from which it inherits properties and methods.
- The prototype chain is used to resolve property and method lookups.
- Constructors have a `prototype` property, while instances have a `__proto__` (or internal prototype).
- Prototypal inheritance allows sharing of methods and properties between objects, forming a core part of JavaScript's object-oriented nature.

Understanding prototypes is crucial for grasping how inheritance works in JavaScript and how you can share functionality between objects.

---

### **129. What are constructors in js and their type .**

---

In JavaScript, **constructors** are special functions used to create and initialize objects. They allow you to define a blueprint for creating multiple objects with similar properties and methods. The `new` keyword is typically used with a constructor function to create instances of objects.

---

### **Types of Constructors in JavaScript**

1. **Function Constructors**
2. **Class Constructors (ES6 Classes)**
3. **Object Constructor**
4. **Custom Constructors**

---

### 1. **Function Constructors**

Before ES6, JavaScript used function constructors to create objects. A constructor function is a regular JavaScript function, but when called with the `new` keyword, it behaves as a constructor and returns an object.

**Syntax**:

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.greet = function () {
    console.log(
      `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`
    );
  };
}

const john = new Person("John", 30);
john.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I'm 30 years old.
```

**Key Points**:

- When you use `new Person()`, the following happens:
  - A new empty object is created.
  - The `this` keyword inside the function refers to this new object.
  - The properties and methods are added to `this`.
  - The new object is returned by the constructor.

---

### 2. **Class Constructors (ES6 Classes)**

In ES6, JavaScript introduced the `class` keyword, which provides a cleaner and more intuitive syntax for creating objects, though it's essentially syntactic sugar over the function constructors.

**Syntax**:

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(
      `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`
    );
  }
}

const jane = new Person("Jane", 25);
jane.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Jane and I'm 25 years old.
```

**Key Points**:

- The `constructor` method inside a class is a special method used for initializing an object.
- Like function constructors, classes are also used with the `new` keyword.
- Methods like `greet()` are automatically added to the prototype of the object, making them memory-efficient (as compared to defining methods inside the function constructor).

---

### 3. **Object Constructor**

JavaScript provides a built-in `Object()` constructor that can be used to create objects. However, it’s rarely used in modern code because object literals (`{}`) are more concise and preferable.

**Syntax**:

```js
const obj = new Object();
obj.name = "Alice";
obj.age = 28;

console.log(obj); // Output: { name: 'Alice', age: 28 }
```

Equivalent object literal:

```js
const obj = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 28,
};
```

**Key Points**:

- The `Object` constructor is the base object from which all objects inherit in JavaScript.
- It's better to use object literals `{}` as they are more readable and concise.

---

### 4. **Custom Constructors**

You can create custom constructors to model more specific behavior for your objects. These can be simple or more complex based on the use case.

**Syntax**:

```js
function Car(brand, model, year) {
  this.brand = brand;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}

const myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020);
console.log(myCar); // Output: Car { brand: 'Toyota', model: 'Camry', year: 2020 }
```

**Key Points**:

- Custom constructors can have properties and methods specific to the object being created.
- Like function constructors, they use the `new` keyword for creating instances.

---

### **Constructor Behavior**:

1. **When you call a constructor with `new`**:

   - A new empty object is created.
   - The constructor function's `this` points to this new object.
   - The constructor sets up the object by assigning properties to `this`.
   - The new object is returned from the function (implicitly, if not returned explicitly).

2. **Without `new`**:

   - If you call a constructor function without `new`, `this` won’t refer to the new object but to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode). This can cause unexpected behavior.

   ```js
   const john = Person("John", 30); // Called without `new`
   console.log(john); // Undefined
   ```

   To ensure constructors are used with `new`, you can check inside the constructor:

   ```js
   function Person(name, age) {
     if (!(this instanceof Person)) {
       return new Person(name, age);
     }
     this.name = name;
     this.age = age;
   }
   ```

---

### **Constructor Prototype**:

Every constructor function has a property called `prototype` that defines the properties and methods shared across all instances created by that constructor.

```js
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.speak = function () {
  console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
};

const dog = new Animal("Dog");
dog.speak(); // Output: Dog makes a sound
```

In this example:

- The `speak` method is added to the `Animal.prototype`.
- All instances of `Animal` share this method, rather than each having its own copy.

---

### **Built-in Constructors**

JavaScript provides several built-in constructors, such as:

- **Object()**: Creates an object.
- **Array()**: Creates an array.
- **Function()**: Creates a function.
- **String()**: Creates a string object.
- **Number()**: Creates a number object.
- **Boolean()**: Creates a boolean object.

Example:

```js
const arr = new Array(1, 2, 3);
console.log(arr); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

However, it’s often better to use literals for most built-in objects like arrays (`[]`), strings (`''`), numbers (`123`), etc.

---

### **Conclusion**:

- **Function Constructors**: Traditional way to create objects in pre-ES6 JavaScript.
- **Class Constructors**: A cleaner and modern way introduced in ES6, but they still use prototypal inheritance under the hood.
- **Object Constructor**: The base constructor for all objects, though object literals are preferable.
- **Custom Constructors**: Allow you to create multiple objects with similar properties and methods.

Using constructors and understanding their types is essential for working with objects and inheritance in JavaScript.

### **128. What is useReducer() hook in React.js and how it can be used to manage complex states?**

The `useReducer` hook in React is a powerful alternative to `useState` for managing complex state logic in functional components. It allows you to manage state transitions in a more predictable manner, especially when the state updates depend on multiple actions or conditions. It is inspired by the reducer pattern from Redux, where state transitions are handled based on the dispatched action.

### Syntax

```js
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

- **`state`**: The current state of your component.
- **`dispatch`**: A function used to send actions to the reducer to update the state.
- **`reducer`**: A pure function that takes the current state and an action, then returns a new state.
- **`initialState`**: The initial value for the state.

### How `useReducer` Works

The `useReducer` hook takes two arguments:

1. A **reducer function**: This function receives the current state and an action, then returns a new state based on the action type.
2. An **initial state**: This is the initial value of the state when the component mounts.

The `dispatch` function is used to trigger changes to the state by sending actions to the reducer.

### Reducer Function

A reducer is simply a function that takes two arguments:

- **state**: The current state of the component.
- **action**: An object that describes how the state should be updated. Typically, it has a `type` property and sometimes a `payload` with additional data.

Here’s an example reducer:

```js
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

### Example: Simple Counter with `useReducer`

```js
import React, { useReducer } from "react";

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error("Unknown action type");
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial State**: The `initialState` is set to `{ count: 0 }`.
2. **Reducer**: The `reducer` function checks the action type to decide how to update the state.
3. **Dispatch**: The `dispatch` function is used to trigger actions (`increment` or `decrement`) that update the state.
4. **State Management**: The state (`count`) is managed in an immutable way, meaning each update creates a new state object instead of modifying the existing state.

### When to Use `useReducer`?

- When state logic becomes complex (e.g., multiple related state variables, complex conditions).
- When state updates depend on previous state values.
- When handling multiple actions that affect the state differently.
- For scenarios like managing forms, where various actions and state properties are involved.

In simpler cases, `useState` might be sufficient, but for more intricate logic, `useReducer` provides a structured and maintainable way to handle state transitions.
